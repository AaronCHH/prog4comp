<h2>What is a program? And what is programming?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-program-and-what-is-programming" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-0">Today, most people are experienced with computer programs, typically
programs such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Internet Explorer, and
Photoshop. The interaction with such programs is usually quite simple
and intuitive: you click on buttons, pull down menus and select
operations, drag visual elements into locations, and so forth. The possible
operations you can do in these programs can be combined in seemingly
an infinite number of ways, only limited by your creativity and
imagination.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, programs often make us frustrated when they cannot do
what we wish. One typical situation might be the following. Say you
have some measurements from a device, and the data are
stored in a file with a specific format.  You may want to analyze
these data in Excel and make some graphics out of it. However, assume
there is no menu in Excel that allows you to import data in this
specific format. Excel can work with many different data formats,
but not this one. You start searching for alternatives to Excel that
can do the same <em>and</em> read this type of data files. Maybe you cannot
find any ready-made program directly applicable. You have reached the
point where knowing how to write programs on your own would be of
great help to you! With some programming skills, you may write your
own little program which can translate one data format to
another. With that little piece of tailored code, your data may be
read and analyzed, perhaps in Excel, or perhaps by a new program
tailored to the computations that the measurement data demand.</p>
<span class="target" id="index-1"></span><span class="target" id="index-2"></span><p id="index-3">The real power of computers can only be utilized if you can program
them. By programming you can get the computer to do (most often!)
exactly what you want. Programming consists of writing a set of
instructions in a very specialized language that has adopted words and
expressions from English. Such languages are known as <em>programming</em> or
<em>computer languages</em>. The set of instructions is given to a program
which can translate the meaning of the instructions into real actions
inside the computer.</p>
<p>The purpose of this book is to teach you to write such instructions
dedicated to solve mathematical and engineering problems by
fundamental numerical methods.</p>
<span class="target" id="index-4"></span><span class="target" id="index-5"></span><span class="target" id="index-6"></span><span class="target" id="index-7"></span><span class="target" id="index-8"></span><span class="target" id="index-9"></span><span class="target" id="index-10"></span><span class="target" id="index-11"></span><span class="target" id="index-12"></span><span class="target" id="index-13"></span><p id="index-14">There are numerous computer languages for different purposes.  Within
the engineering area, the most widely used computer languages are
Python, MATLAB, Octave, Fortran, C, C++, and to some extent Maple, and
Mathematica.  How you write the instructions (i.e. the <em>syntax</em>)
differs between the languages. Let us use an analogy.</p>
<p>Assume you are an international kind of person, having friends abroad
in England, Russia and China. They want to try your favorite
cake. What can you do? Well, you may write down the recipe in those
three languages and send them over. Now, if you have be able to think
correctly when writing down the recipe, and you have written the
explanations according to the rules in each language, each of your
friends will produce the same cake. Your recipe is the &#8220;computer
program&#8221;, while English, Russian and Chinese represent the &#8220;computer
languages&#8221; with their own rules of how to write things. The end
product, though, is still the same cake. Note that you may
unintentionally introduce errors in your &#8220;recipe&#8221;. Depending on the
error, this may cause &#8220;baking execution&#8221; to stop, or perhaps produce
the wrong cake. In your computer program, the errors you introduce are
called bugs (yes, small insects! ...for historical reasons), and the
process of fixing them is called debugging. When you try to run your
program that contains errors, you usually get warnings or error
messages. However, the response you get depends on the error and the
programming language. You may even get no response, but simply the
wrong &#8220;cake&#8221;. Note that the rules of a programming language have to be
followed very strictly. This differs from languages like English etc.,
where the meaning might be understood even if with spelling errors and
&#8220;slang&#8221; included.</p>
<p>This book comes in two versions, one that is based on Python, and one
based on Matlab. Both Python and Matlab represent excellent
programming environments for scientific and engineering tasks. The
version you are reading now, is the Matlab version.</p>
<p>Readers who want to expand their scientific programming skills beyond
the introductory level of the present exposition, are encouraged to
study the book <em>A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python</em> <a class="reference internal" href="._pylight009.html#ref19" id="id1">[Ref19]</a>.
This comprehensive book is
as suitable for beginners as for professional programmers, and teaches
the art of programming through a huge collection of dedicated
examples. This book is considered the primary reference, and a
natural extension, of the programming matters in the present book.</p>
<span class="target" id="index-15"></span><div class="admonition-some-computer-science-terms admonition" id="index-16">
<p class="first admonition-title">Some computer science terms</p>
<p>Note that, quite often, the terms <em>script</em> and <em>scripting</em> are used as
synonyms for program and programming, respectively, especially
when using Matlab and a few lines of code can do much.</p>
<p>The inventor of the Perl programming language, Larry Wall, tried
to explain the difference between script and program in a humorous way
(from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.perl.com/pub/2007/12/06/soto-11.html">perl.com</a>):
<em>Suppose you went back to `Ada Lovelace &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace&gt;`__ and asked her the difference between a script and a program. She&#8217;d probably look at you funny, then say something like: Well, a script is what you give the actors, but a program is what you give the audience. That Ada was one sharp lady...
Since her time, we seem to have gotten a bit more confused about what we mean when we say scripting. It confuses even me, and I&#8217;m supposed to be one of the experts.</em></p>
<p>There are many other widely used computer science terms to pick up. Writing
a program (or script or code) is often expressed as
<em>implementing</em> the program. <em>Executing</em> a program means running the program.
An <em>algorithm</em> is a recipe for how to construct a program. A <em>bug</em> is
an error in a program, and the art of tracking down and
removing bugs is called <em>debugging</em>.</p>
<p class="last"><em>Simulating</em> or <em>simulation</em> refers to using a program to mimic processes
in the real world, often through solving differential equations that
govern the physics of the processes.</p>

<p>Our first example regards programming the mathematical model for
throwing a ball up in the air. From Newton&#8217;s 2nd
law, and by assuming negligible air resistance, one can derive a
mathematical model that predicts the vertical position <span class="math">\(y\)</span> of the ball
at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>. From the model one gets the formula</p>
<div class="math">
\[y = v_0 t - 0.5gt^2  ,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(v_0\)</span> is the initial upwards velocity and <span class="math">\(g\)</span> is the
acceleration of gravity, for which <span class="math">\(9.81\hbox{ ms}^{-2}\)</span> is a
reasonable value (even if it depends on things like location on the
earth). With this formula at hand, and when <span class="math">\(v_0\)</span> is known, you may
plug in a value for time and get out the corresponding height.</p>

<h3>The program<a class="headerlink" href="#the-program" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p id="index-17">Let us next look at a Matlab program for evaluating this simple formula.
Assume the program is contained as text in a file named
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ball.m</span></code>. The text looks as follows (file

<h3>Dissection of the program<a class="headerlink" href="#dissection-of-the-program" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

contains instructions to the computer. Humans can read the code
and understand what the program is capable of doing,
but the program itself does not
trigger any actions on a computer before another program, the Matlab
interpreter, reads the program text and translates this text into
specific actions.</p>
<div class="admonition-you-must-learn-to-play-a-computer admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">You must learn to play a computer</p>
<p class="last">Although Matlab is responsible for reading and understanding your
program, it is of fundamental importance that you fully understand the
program yourself. You have to know the implication of every
instruction in the program and be able to figure out the consequences
of the instructions.  In other words, you must be able to play a
computer. The reason for this strong demand of knowledge
is that you very often commit errors in the program text, and to
track down these errors, you have to simulate what the computer
does with the program. Next, we shall explain all the text in
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ball.m</span></code> in full detail.</p>
</div>
<p>Matlab will next start to read your file, line by line, from the
top. The first line it reads is</p>
<div class="highlight-matlab"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">% Program for computing the height of a ball in vertical motion.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This line is what we call a <em>comment</em>. That is, the line is not meant
for Matlab to read and execute, but rather for a human that reads the
code and tries to understand what is going on. Therefore, one rule in
Matlab says that whenever Matlab encounters the sign <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%</span></code>
it takes the rest of the line as a comment. Matlab then simply skips
reading the rest of the line and jumps to the next line. In the code,
you see several such comments and probably realize that they make it
easier for you to understand (or guess) what is meant with the
code. In this simple cases, comments are probably not much needed, but
will soon be justified as the level of complexity steps up.</p>
<p>The next line read by Matlab is</p>
<div class="highlight-matlab"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">v0</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">;</span>   <span class="c">% Initial velocity</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<span class="target" id="index-24"></span><p id="index-25">According to its rules, Matlab will now create a <em>variable</em> with the
name <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">v0</span></code> and set (the value of) that variable equal to 5. We say that
5 is <em>assigned</em> to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">v0</span></code>. This means that whenever Matlab reads <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">v0</span></code>
hereafter, it plugs in 5 instead of the name <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">v0</span></code>, since it knows that
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">v0</span></code> has the value 5. You may think of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">v0</span></code> as a variable <span class="math">\(v_0\)</span>
in mathematics. The next two lines</p>
<div class="highlight-matlab"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">g</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="mf">9.81</span><span class="p">;</span>  <span class="c">% Acceleration of gravity</span>
<span class="n">t</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="mf">0.6</span><span class="p">;</span>   <span class="c">% Time</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>are of the same kind, so having read them too, Matlab knows of three
variables (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">v0</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">g</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">t</span></code>) and their values. These variables are then
used by Matlab when it reads the next line, the actual &#8220;formula&#8221;,</p>
<div class="highlight-matlab" id="index-26"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">y</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">v0</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mf">0.5</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">g</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">t</span>^<span class="mi">2</span>            <span class="c">% Vertical position</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Again, according to its rules, Matlab interprets <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*</span></code> as
multiplication, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-</span></code> as minus and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">^</span></code>
as exponent (let us also add
here that, not surprisingly, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">+</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/</span></code> would have been understood as
addition and division, if such signs had been present in the
expression). Having read the line, Matlab performs the mathematics
on the right-hand side,
and then assigns the result (in this case the number <span class="math">\(1.2342\)</span>) to the
variable <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span></code>.
Also, since the final line has no semi-colon, Matlab understands that
we also want the result printed to screen. When <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ball.m</span></code> is run,
the number <span class="math">\(1.2342\)</span> appears on the screen.</p>
<p>Note that the &#8220;skipping&#8221; of semi-colon provides an easy way to print
things to screen in general. Simply writing, e.g., <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">v0</span></code> in the program
above, i.e. without the semi-colon, will make the content of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">v0</span></code> be
printed to screen.</p>
<p>In the code above, you see several blank lines too. These are simply
skipped by Matlab and you may use as many as you want to make a nice
and readable layout of the code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-not-just-use-a-pocket-calculator">
<h3>Why not just use a pocket calculator?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-not-just-use-a-pocket-calculator" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p id="index-27">Certainly, finding the answer as done by the program above could
easily have been done with a pocket calculator. No objections to that
and no programming would have been needed. However, what if you would
like to have the position of the ball for every milli-second of the
flight? All that punching on the calculator would have taken you
something like four hours!  If you know how to program, however, you
could modify the code above slightly, using a minute or two of
writing, and easily get all the positions computed in one go within a
second.  A much stronger argument, however, is that mathematical
models from real life are often complicated and comprehensive.  The
pocket calculator cannot cope with such problems, even not the
programmable ones, because their computational power and their
programming tools are far too weak compared to a real computer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-importance-of-using-a-text-editor-to-write-programs">
<h3>The importance of using a text editor to write programs<a class="headerlink" href="#the-importance-of-using-a-text-editor-to-write-programs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<span class="target" id="index-28"></span><p id="index-29">When Matlab interprets some code in a file, it is concerned with
every character in the file, exactly as it was typed in.
This makes it troublesome to write
the code into a file with word processors like, e.g., Microsoft Word,
since such a program will insert extra characters, invisible to us, with
information on how to format the text (e.g., the font size and type).
Such extra information is necessary for the text to be nicely
formatted for the human eye. Matlab will be much annoyed by
the extra characters in the file inserted by a word processor.
Therefore, it is fundamental that you write your program in a
<em>text editor</em> where what you type on the keyboard is <em>exactly</em> the
characters that appear in the file and that Matlab will later read.
There are many text editors around. Some are stand-alone programs like
Emacs, Vim, Gedit, Notepad++, and TextWrangler.
Many prefer to use the text editor that comes with the graphical Matlab
environment.</p>

program yourself and practice heavily before you master mathematical
problem solving via programming. Therefore, it is crucial at this stage that you
write and run a Matlab program. We just went through the program <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ball.m</span></code>
above, so let us next write and run that code.</p>
<p>But first a warning: there are many things at that must play
together correctly for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ball.m</span></code> to run correctly on
your computer. There might
be problems with your Matlab installation, with your writing of the
program (it is very easy to introduce errors!),
or with the location of the file, just to mention some of the
most common difficulties for beginners. Fortunately, such problems are
solvable, and if you do not understand how to fix the
problem, ask somebody. Typically, once you are beyond these common
start-up problems, you can move on to learn
programming and how programs can do a lot of otherwise complicated
mathematics for you.</p>
<p>The term <em>Matlab</em> refers to both the software package Matlab from
MathWorks Inc., and the programming language Matlab.
Matlab programs can either be run in the commercial Matlab software package, or
they can be run in the free
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">GNU Octave</a> software,
usually just called Octave.
We first describe how to operate the Matlab software and then
Octave.</p>
<p>The first step is to generate a directory in which you will place your
future Matlab code. Do this in a terminal window (<em>Terminal</em> on Mac,
<em>Power Shell</em> or <em>Command Prompt</em> on Windows, or (e.g.) <em>gnome-terminal</em> on
Linux). Write <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mkdir</span> <span class="pre">mycode</span></code> to create a directory with name <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mycode</span></code>.
Then move into that directory by writing <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cd</span> <span class="pre">mycode</span></code>.</p>

<span id="st-ex2"></span><h2>A Matlab program with a library function<a class="headerlink" href="#a-matlab-program-with-a-library-function" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Imagine you stand on a distance, say <span class="math">\(10\)</span> m away, watching someone
throwing a ball upwards. A straight line from you to the ball will
then make an angle with the horizontal that increases and decreases as
the ball goes up and down. Let us consider the ball at a particular
moment in time, at which it has a height of <span class="math">\(10\)</span> m.</p>
<p>What is the angle of the line then? Again, this could easily be done
with a calculator, but we continue to address gentle mathematical
problems when learning to program. Before thinking of writing a program,
one should always formulate the <em>algorithm</em>, i.e., the recipe for what
kind of calculations that must be performed. Here, if the ball is
<span class="math">\(x\)</span> m away and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> m up in the air, it makes an angle <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> with
the ground, where <span class="math">\(\tan\theta = y/x\)</span>. The angle is then <span class="math">\(\tan^{-1}(y/x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let us make a Matlab program for doing these calculations. We introduce
variables <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span></code> for the position data <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, and the
descriptive name <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">angle</span></code> for the angle <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span>.

take a look at one new thing in the code. The line <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">angle</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">atan(y/x)</span></code>,
illustrates how the <em>function</em> <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atan</span></code>, corresponding to <span class="math">\(\tan^{-1}\)</span>
in mathematics, is <em>called</em> with the
ratio <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y/x</span></code> as <em>input parameter</em> or <em>argument</em>.
The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atan</span></code> function takes one argument, and the computed value is
<em>returned</em> from <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atan</span></code>. This means that where we see <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atan(y/x)</span></code>,
a computation is performed (<span class="math">\(\tan^{-1}(y/x)\)</span>) and the result &#8220;replaces&#8221;
the text <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atan(y/x)</span></code>. This is actually no more magic than if we
had written just <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y/x</span></code>: then the computation of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y/x</span></code> would take place,
and the result of that division would replace the text <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y/x</span></code>.
Thereafter, the result is assigned to the variable <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">angle</span></code>
on the left-hand side of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">=</span></code>.</p>
<p>Note that the trigonometric functions, such as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atan</span></code>, work with
angles in radians. The return value of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atan</span></code> must hence be converted
to degrees, and that is why we perform the computation <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(angle/pi)*180</span></code>.
With the missing semi-colon, Matlab will do the computations <em>and</em>
print the result to the screen. And yes, the famous
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pi</span></code> (<span class="math">\(\pi\)</span>) is a variable that is known
to Matlab.</p>

have a formula for the vertical position <span class="math">\(y\)</span> of the ball.  Say we are

As you notice, the code lines from the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ball.m</span></code> program
in the chapter <a class="reference internal" href="#st-ex1"><span>A Matlab program with variables</span></a> have not changed much, but

<p>Let us look at the differences the new program and our previous program.</p>
<p id="index-50">The function <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">linspace</span></code> takes <span class="math">\(3\)</span> parameters, and is generally called as</p>

<p>This is our first example of a Matlab function that takes multiple

coordinates, starting with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">start</span></code> and ending with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stop</span></code>. The
expression <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">linspace(0,</span> <span class="pre">1,</span> <span class="pre">1001)</span></code> creates 1001 coordinates between 0
and 1 (including both 0 and 1). The mathematically inclined reader
will notice that 1001 coordinates corresponds to 1000 equal-sized
intervals in <span class="math">\([0,1]\)</span> and that the coordinates are then given by <span class="math">\(t_i =

<p>The value returned from <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">linspace</span></code> and stored in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">t</span></code> is an <em>array</em>,
i.e., a collection of numbers. When we start computing with this
collection of numbers in the arithmetic expression
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">v0*t</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">0.5*g*t^2</span></code>
the expression is calculated for
every number in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">t</span></code> (i.e., every <span class="math">\(t_i\)</span> for <span class="math">\(i = 0, 1,..., 1000\)</span>), yielding a similar collection of 1001 numbers in the result <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span></code>. That is, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span></code> is also an array.</p>
<p>This technique of computing all numbers &#8220;in one chunk&#8221; is referred to
as <em>vectorization</em>. When it can be used, it is very handy, since both
the amount of code and computation time is reduced compared to writing

programming to solve mathematical problems. Before we can go on with
other and more realistic examples, we need to briefly treat some
topics that will be frequently required in later chapters. These

<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">^</span></code> appear in an expression, Matlab gives them a certain
precedence. Matlab interprets the expression from left to right,
taking one term (part of expression between two successive <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">+</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-</span></code>)
at a time. Within each term, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">^</span></code>
is done before <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/</span></code>. Consider
the expression
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">1*5^2</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">10*3</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">1.0/4</span></code>.
There are three terms here
and interpreting this, Matlab starts from the left. In the first term,
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1*5^2</span></code>,
it first does <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">5^2</span></code> which equals 25. This is then
multiplied by 1 to give 25 again. The second term is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">10*3</span></code>, i.e.,
30. So the first two terms add up to 55. The last term gives 0.25, so
the final result is 54.75 which becomes the value of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code>.</p>
<p>Note that parentheses are often very important to group parts of
expressions together in the intended way. Let us say <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">4</span></code> and that
you want to divide 1.0 by <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">1</span></code>. We know the answer is 0.2, but the
way we present the task to Matlab is critical, as shown by the
following example.</p>
<div class="highlight-matlab"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span>

   <span class="mf">0.2000000000000</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In the first try, we see that 1.0 is divided by <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code> (i.e., 4), giving
0.25, which is then added to 1. Matlab did not understand that our
complete denominator was <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x+1</span></code>. In our second try, we used parentheses
to &#8220;group&#8221; the denominator, and we got what we wanted. That is,
<em>almost</em> what we wanted! Since most numbers can be represented only
approximately on the computer, this gives rise to what is called
<em>round-off</em> errors. We should have got 0.2 as our answer, but the
inexact number representation gave a small error. Usually, such errors
are so small compared to the other numbers of the calculation that we
do not need to bother with them. Still, keep it in mind, since you
will encounter this issue from time to time.</p>

<h3>Variables<a class="headerlink" href="#variables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

Real numbers are in
computer language referred to as <em>floating point numbers</em>, being the
<em>default</em> (i.e. what Matlab uses if nothing is specified) data type in
Matlab. These are of two kinds, <em>single</em> and <em>double</em>, corresponding
to single and double precision, respectively. It is the &#8220;double&#8221; that
is the default type. With double precision, twice as many bits (<span class="math">\(64\)</span>)
are used for storage as with single precision. Writing <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">2</span></code> in some
Matlab program, by default makes <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code> a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">double</span></code>, i.e. a float
variable.</p>
<p>Whole numbers may be stored more memory efficiently as <em>integers</em>,
however, and there are several ways of doing this. For example,
writing <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">int8(2)</span></code>, or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">int16(2)</span></code>, will store the integer <span class="math">\(2\)</span>
in the variable <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code> by use of <span class="math">\(8\)</span> or <span class="math">\(16\)</span> bits, respectively.</p>
<p>Another common type of variable is a <em>string</em>, which we get by
writing, e.g., <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">'This</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">string'</span></code>. The variable <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code> then becomes
a string variable containing the text between single quotes (the
string actually becomes an <em>array</em> of characters, see &#8220;Arrays&#8221; below).
Several other standard data types also exist in
Matlab.</p>
<p>You may also convert between variable types in different ways. For
example, after first writing <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">2</span></code> (which causes <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code> to become a
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">double</span></code>), you may write <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">single(x)</span></code> to make <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span></code> contain the
number <span class="math">\(2\)</span> with single precision only.  Type conversion may also occur
automatically, e.g. when calling a ready-made Matlab function that
requires input data to be of a certain type. When combining variables
of different types, the result will have a type according to given
rules. For example, multiplying a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">single</span></code> and a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">double</span></code>, gives a
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">single</span></code> variable.</p>
<p>Names of variables should be chosen so that they are descriptive. When
computing a mathematical quantity that has some standard symbol,
e.g. <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>, this should be reflected in the name by letting the
word <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">alpha</span></code> be part of the name for the corresponding variable in the
program. If you, e.g., have a variable for counting the number of
sheep, then one appropriate name could be <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">no_of_sheep</span></code>. Such naming
makes it much easier for a human to understand the written
code. Variable names may also contain any digit from 0 to 9, or
underscores, but can not start with a digit. Letters may be lower or
upper case, which to Matlab is different. Note that certain names in
Matlab are <em>reserved</em>, meaning that you can not use these as names for
variables. Some examples are <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">while</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">else</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">end</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">global</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">function</span></code>. If you accidentally use a reserved word as a
variable name you get an error message.</p>
<p>We have seen that, e.g., <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">2</span></code> will assign the value <span class="math">\(2\)</span> to the
variable <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code>. But how do we write it if we want to increase <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code> by 4?
We may then write an assignment like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">4</span></code>. Now Matlab
interprets this as: &#8220;take whatever value that is in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code>, add 4, and
let the result become the new value of <cite>x</cite>&#8221;. In other words, the <em>old</em>
value of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code> is used on the right hand side of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">=</span></code>, no matter how
messy the expression might be, and the result becomes the new value of
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code>. In a similar way, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">4</span></code> reduces the value of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code> by <span class="math">\(4\)</span>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span>
<span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">x*4</span></code> multiplies <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code> by <span class="math">\(4\)</span>, and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">x/4</span></code> divides <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code> by <span class="math">\(4\)</span>,
updating the value of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code> accordingly.</p>

<h3>Formatting text and numbers<a class="headerlink" href="#formatting-text-and-numbers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<span class="target" id="index-73"></span><span class="target" id="index-74"></span><p id="index-75">Results from scientific computations are often to be reported
as a mixture of text and numbers. Usually, we want to control
how numbers are formatted. For example, we may want to write 1/3
as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0.33</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">3.3333e-01</span></code> (<span class="math">\(3.3333\cdot 10^{-1}\)</span>).
The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fprintf</span></code> command is the key
tool to write out text and numbers with full control of
the formatting. The first argument to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fprintf</span></code>
is a string with a particular syntax to specify the formatting, the
so-called <em>printf syntax</em>. (The peculiar name stems from the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">printf</span></code>
function in the programming language C where the syntax was first
introduced.)</p>
<p>Suppose we have a real number 12.89643, an integer 42, and
a text <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'some</span> <span class="pre">message'</span></code> that we want to write out in
the following two alternative ways:</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>real=12.896, integer=42, string=some message
real=1.290e+01, integer=   42, string=some message
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The real number is first written in <em>decimal notation</em> with three
decimals, as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">12.896</span></code>, but afterwards in <em>scientific notation</em>
as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1.290e+01</span></code>. The integer is first written as compactly as
possible, while on the second line, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">42</span></code> is formatted in a
text field of width equal to five characters.</p>
<p>The following program,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/hplgit/prog4comp/src/m/formatted_print.m">formatted_print.m</a>,
applies the printf syntax to control
the formatting displayed above:</p>
<div class="highlight-matlab"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">real</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="mf">12.89643</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">integer</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">string</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;some message&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">fprintf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;real=%.3f, integer=%d, string=%s&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">real</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">integer</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">string</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">fprintf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;real=%9.3e, integer=%5d, string=%s&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">real</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">integer</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">string</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The output of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fprintf</span></code> is a string,
specified in terms of text and a set of variables to be inserted in the text.
Variables are inserted in the text at places indicated by <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%</span></code>.
After <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%</span></code> comes a specification of the formatting, e.g, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%f</span></code>
(real number with six decimals), <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%d</span></code> (integer), or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%s</span></code> (string).
The format <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%9.3f</span></code> means a real number in decimal notation, with
3 decimals, written in a field of width equal to 9 characters.
The variant <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%.3f</span></code> means that the number is written as compactly as
possible, in decimal notation, with three decimals. Switching
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">f</span></code> with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">e</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">E</span></code> results in the scientific notation, here
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1.290e+01</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1.290E+01</span></code>. Writing <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%5d</span></code> means that an integer
is to be written in a field of width equal to 5 characters.
Real numbers can also be specified with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%g</span></code>, which is used
to automatically choose between decimal or scientific
notation, from what gives the most compact output
(typically scientific notation for very small and very large numbers
and decimal notation for the intermediate range).</p>
<p>A typical example when printf formatting is required arises when
printing nicely aligned column of numbers. Suppose we want to
print a column of <span class="math">\(t\)</span> values together with associated function
values <span class="math">\(g(t)=t\sin(t)\)</span> in a second column. The simplest approach
would be</p>
<div class="highlight-matlab"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">n</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">t0</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">dt</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="mf">0.55</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c">% Unformatted print</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="nb">i</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">n</span>

  <span class="n">g</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nb">sin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="n">fprintf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;%f %f\n&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>with output</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>2.550000 1.422093
3.100000 0.128900
3.650000 -1.776771
4.200000 -3.660618
4.750000 -4.746641
5.300000 -4.411017
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The numbers are not nicely aligned. Using the printf syntax
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'%6.2f</span>&nbsp; <span class="pre">%8.3f'</span></code> for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">t</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">g</span></code>, we can control how wide each
column is and also the number of decimals such that the numbers
in a column are written with the same precision. The output
then becomes</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>2.00     1.819
2.55     1.422
3.10     0.129
3.65    -1.777
4.20    -3.661
4.75    -4.747
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We shall frequently use the printf syntax throughout the book so there
will be plenty of further examples.</p>

1001 height computations were executed and stored in the variable <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span></code>,
and then displayed in a plot showing <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span></code> versus <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">t</span></code>, i.e., height
versus time. The collection of numbers in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span></code> (or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">t</span></code>, respectively)
was stored in what is called an <em>array</em>, a construction also found in
most other programming languages. Such arrays are created and
treated according to certain rules, and as a programmer, you may
direct Matlab to compute and handle arrays as a whole, or as
individual <em>array elements</em>. Let us briefly look at a smaller such
collection of numbers.</p>
<p>Assume that the heights of four family members have been collected. These heights may be generated and stored in an array, e.g., named <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">h</span></code>, by writing</p>
<div class="highlight-matlab"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">h</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="nb">zeros</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">h</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="mf">1.60</span>
<span class="n">h</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="mf">1.85</span>
<span class="n">h</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="mf">1.75</span>
<span class="n">h</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="mf">1.80</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where the array elements appear as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">h(1)</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">h(2)</span></code>, etc. Generally, when we read or talk about the array elements of some array <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code>, we refer to them by reading or saying &#8220;a of one&#8221; (i.e. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a(1)</span></code>), &#8220;a of two&#8221; (i.e. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a(2)</span></code>), and so on.
The very first line in the example above, i.e.</p>
<div class="highlight-matlab"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">h</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="nb">zeros</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>instructs Matlab to reserve, or <em>allocate</em>, space in memory for an
array <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">h</span></code> with four elements and initial values set to 0.
(Note that <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">zeros(4,1)</span></code> gives a column array, while <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">zeros(1,4)</span></code> gives
a line array. Try it at the command prompt to see the
difference. Sometimes this distinction is important, e.g. when doing
matrix - vector calculations.)
The next four lines command Matlab to overwrite the zeros with the
desired numbers (measured heights), one number for each
element. Elements are, by rule, <em>indexed</em> (numbers within parentheses)
from <span class="math">\(1\)</span> to the last element, in this case <span class="math">\(4\)</span>. We say that Matlab has
<em>one-based indexing</em>. This differs from <em>zero-based indexing</em> (e.g.,
found in Python) where the array index starts with <span class="math">\(0\)</span>.</p>
<p id="index-83">As illustrated in the code, you may refer to the array as a whole by
the name <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">h</span></code>, but also to each individual element by use of the
index. The array elements may enter in computations as individual
variables, e.g., writing
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">z</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">h(1)</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">h(2)</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">h(3)</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">h(4)</span></code> will compute
the sum of all the elements in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">h</span></code>, while the result is assigned to
the variable <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">z</span></code>. Note that this way of creating an array is a bit
different from the one with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">linspace</span></code>, where the filling in of
numbers occurred automatically &#8220;behind the scene&#8221;.</p>
<p id="index-84">By use of a colon, you may pick out a <em>slice</em> of an array. For
example, to create a new array from the two elements <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">h(1)</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">h(2)</span></code>, we could write <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">slice_h</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">h(1:2)</span></code>. For the generated <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">slice_h</span></code>
array, indices are as usual, i.e., <span class="math">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(2\)</span> in this case. The very
last entry in an array may be addressed as, e.g., <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">h(length(h))</span></code>,
where the ready made function <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">length</span></code> gives the number of elements in
the array.</p>

<p>Notice the use of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hold</span></code> here. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hold('on')</span></code> tells Matlab

Matlab does so until it reads <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hold('off')</span></code>. If you do not use the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hold('on')</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hold('off')</span></code> command,
the second plot command will overwrite the first one, i.e.,
you get only the second curve.</p>
<p id="index-87">In case you would like the two curves plotted in two separate plots, you can do this by plotting the first curve straightforwardly with</p>

<p>Note how the graphs are made continuous by Matlab, drawing straight

height computations with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ball_plot.m</span></code> in the chapter <a class="reference internal" href="#st-ex3"><span>A Matlab program with vectorization and plotting</span></a>. However, since there were so many data points then, the
curve looked nice and smooth. If preferred, one may also plot only the
data points. For example, writing</p>

<h3>Error messages and warnings<a class="headerlink" href="#error-messages-and-warnings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p id="index-99">All programmers experience error messages, and usually to a large
extent during the early learning process. Sometimes error messages
are understandable, sometimes they are not. Anyway, it is important
to get used to them. One idea is to start with a program that
initially is working, and then deliberately introduce errors in
it, one by one. (But remember to take a copy of the original working
code!)
For each error you try to run the program to
see what Matlab&#8217;s response is. Then you know what the problem is
and understand what the error message is about. This will greatly
help you when you get a similar error message or warning later.</p>
<span class="target" id="index-100"></span><p id="index-101">Very often, you will experience that there are errors in the program
you have written. This is normal, but frustrating in the
beginning. You then have to find the problem, try to fix it, and then
run the program again. Typically, you fix one error just to experience
that another error is waiting around the corner. However, after some
time you start to avoid the most common beginner&#8217;s errors, and things
run more smoothly. The process of finding and fixing errors, called
<em>debugging</em>, is very important to learn. There are different ways of
doing it too.</p>
<p>A special program (<em>debugger</em>) may be used to help you check (and
do) different things in the program you need to fix. A simpler
procedure, that often brings you a long way, is to print information
to the screen from different places in the program. First of all, this
is something you should do (several times) during program development
anyway, so that things get checked as you go along. However, if the
final program still ends up with error messages, you might save a copy
of it, and do some testing on the copy. Useful testing may then be to
remove, e.g., the latter half of the program (by inserting comment
signs <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%</span></code>), and insert print commands at clever places to see what is
the case. When the first half looks ok, insert parts of what was
removed and repeat the process with the new code. Using simple numbers
and doing this in parallel with hand calculations on a piece of paper
(for comparison) is often a very good idea.</p>
<span class="target" id="index-102"></span><span class="target" id="index-103"></span><p id="index-104">Python also offers means to detect and handle errors by the program
itself! The programmer must then foresee (when writing the code) that
there is a potential for error at some particular point. If, for
example, some user of the program is asked (by the running program) to
provide a number, and intends to give the number 5, but instead writes
the word <em>five</em>, the program could run into trouble. A
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*try-exception*.m</span></code> construction may be used by
the programmer to check for such errors and act appropriately (see
the chapter <a class="reference internal" href="._pylight007.html#th-nonlinalgeq-newt"><span>Newton&#8217;s method</span></a> for an example), avoiding a program
crash. This procedure of trying an action and then recovering from
trouble, if necessary, is referred to as <em>exception handling</em> and
is the modern way of dealing with errors in a program.</p>
<span class="target" id="index-105"></span><p id="index-106">When a program finally runs without error messages, it might be
tempting to think that <em>Ah..., I am finished!</em>. But no! Then comes
program <em>testing</em>, you need to <em>verify</em> that the program does the
computations as planned. This is almost an art and usually takes
much more time than to develop the program, but the program is
useless unless you have much evidence showing that the computations
are correct.</p>
<div class="admonition-verification-versus-validation admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Verification versus validation</p>
<p class="last">Verification is important, but <em>validation</em> is equally
important. It is great if your program can do the calculations
according to the plan, <em>but</em> is it the right plan? Put otherwise, you
need to check that the computations run correctly according to the
<em>formula you have chosen/derived</em>. This is <em>verification</em>: doing the
things right.  Thereafter, you must also check whether the formula you
have chosen/derived is <em>the right</em> formula for the case you are
investigating. This is <em>validation</em>: doing the right things.  In the
present book, it is beyond scope to question how well the mathematical
models describe a given phenomenon in nature or engineering, as the
answer usually involves extensive knowledge of the application area.
We will therefore limit our testing to the verification part.</p>

<h3>Input data<a class="headerlink" href="#input-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

use these data to compute output data, i.e., results.
In the previous program we have specified input data in terms
of variables. However, one often wants to get the input through
some dialog with the user. Here is one example where the
program asks a question, and the user provides an answer by
typing on the keyboard:</p>
<div class="highlight-matlab"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">age</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;What is your age? &#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">fprintf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;Ok, so you are half way to %d, wow!\n&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">age</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So, after having interpreted and run the first line, Matlab has
established the variable <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">age</span></code> and assigned your input to it. The
second line combines the calculation of twice the age with a message
printed on the screen. Try these two lines in a little test program to
see for yourself how it works.</p>
<p>There are other ways of providing input to a program as well, e.g.,
via a graphical interface (as many readers will be used to) or at the
command line (i.e., as parameters succeeding, on the same line, the
command that starts the program). Reading data from a file is yet
another way. Logically, what the program produces when run, e.g. a
plot or printout to the screen or a file, is referred to as <em>program
output</em>.</p>

<div class="section" id="symbolic-computations">
<h3>Symbolic computations<a class="headerlink" href="#symbolic-computations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<span class="target" id="index-113"></span><span class="target" id="index-114"></span><span class="target" id="index-115"></span><p id="index-116">Even though the main focus in this book is programming of <em>numerical</em>
methods, there are occasions where <em>symbolic</em> (also called <em>exact</em> or <em>analytical</em>)
operations are useful.
Doing symbolic computations means, as the name suggests, that we do
computations with the symbols themselves rather than with the
numerical values they could represent. Let us illustrate the
difference between symbolic and numerical computations with a little
example. A numerical computation could be</p>
<div class="highlight-matlab"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">y</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">z</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">y</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>which will make the number 6 appear on the screen.
A symbolic counterpart of this code could be</p>
<div class="highlight-matlab"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">syms</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="n">y</span>
<span class="n">z</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">y</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>which causes the <em>symbolic</em> result <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x*y</span></code> to appear on the screen.
Note that no numerical value was assigned to any of the variables
in the symbolic computation. Only the symbols were used, as when
you do symbolic mathematics by hand on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Symbolic computations in Matlab make use of the
<em>Symbolic Toolbox</em> (but support for symbolic computations in Octave
is weak).
Each symbol is represented
by a standard variable, but the name of the symbol must be
declared with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">syms</span> <span class="pre">name</span></code> for a single symbol, or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">syms</span> <span class="pre">name1</span> <span class="pre">name2</span> <span class="pre">...</span></code> for multiple symbols.
The following script
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/hplgit/prog4comp/src/m/example_symbolic.m">example_symbolic.m</a>
is a quick demonstration
of some of the basic symbolic operations that are supported in Matlab.</p>

<p>Other symbolic calculations like Taylor series expansion, linear algebra (with matrix and vector operations), and (some) differential equation solving are also possible.</p>
<span class="target" id="index-117"></span><p id="index-118">Symbolic computations are also readily accessible through the free
online tool <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wolframalpha.com">WolframAlpha</a>, which
applies the very advanced <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematica">Mathematica</a> package as symbolic engine.
The disadvantage with WolframAlpha compared to the
Symbolic Toolbox is that the results cannot
automatically be imported into your code and used for further
analysis. On the other hand, WolframAlpha has the advantage that it
displays many additional mathematical results related to the given
problem. For example, if we type <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">2x</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">3x</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">y</span></code> in WolframAlpha, it
not only reduced the expression to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">5x</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">y</span></code>, but it also makes plots
of the function <span class="math">\(f(x,y)=5x-y\)</span>, solves the equation <span class="math">\(5x - y = 0\)</span>, and
calculates the integral <span class="math">\(\int\int(5x+y)dxdy\)</span>. The commercial Pro
version can also show a step-by-step of the analytical computations in
the problem. You are strongly encouraged to try out these commands in
WolframAlpha:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">diff(x^2,</span> <span class="pre">x)</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">diff(x**2,</span> <span class="pre">x)</span></code></li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">integrate(cos(x),</span> <span class="pre">x)</span></code></li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">simplify((x**2</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">x**3)/x**2)</span></code></li>

be done in Matlab. Hopefully, you have tried to do the examples on
your own. If you have, most certainly you have discovered that what
you write in the code has to be <em>very accurate</em>. For example, with our
previous example of four heights collected in an array <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">h</span></code>, writing
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">h[1]</span></code> instead of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">h(1)</span></code>
gives an error, even if you and I know
perfectly well what you mean! Remember that it is not a human that
runs your code, it is a machine. Therefore, even if the meaning of
your code looks fine to a human eye, it still has to comply in detail
to the rules of the programming language. If not, you get warnings and
error messages. This also goes for lower and upper case letters.
Pay attention to such details also when they are given in later chapters.</p>

<div class="admonition-remember-to-insert-comments-to-explain-your-code admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Remember to insert comments to explain your code</p>
<p>When you write a computer program, you have two very
different kinds of readers. One is Matlab, which will interpret and
run your program according to the rules. The other is some
human, for example, yourself or a peer. It is very
important to organize and comment the code so that you can go back to
your own code after, e.g., a year and still understand what clever
constructions you put in there. This is relevant when you need to change or
extend your code (which usually happens often in reality). Organized
coding and good commenting is even more critical if other people are
supposed to understand code that you have written.</p>
<p class="last">One important contribution to writing readable code, is to <em>indent</em>
parts of the code that naturally belong together. You will see this

<p class="last">Numerical computing has a strong tradition in paying much attention to
creating <em>fast code</em>. Real industrial applications of numerical computing
often involves simulations that run for hours, days, and even weeks.
Fast code is tremendously important in those cases. The problem with
a strong focus on fast code, unfortunately, is sometimes that clear
and easily understandable constructions are replaced by clever and
less readable, but faster code. However, for beginners it is most
important to learn to write readable and correct code. We will
make some comments on constructions that are fast or slow, but the
main focus of this book is to teach how to write correct programs,
not the fastest possible programs.</p>

<p>Save a copy of the program <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ball.m</span></code> and confirm that the copy runs as the
original. You are now supposed to introduce errors in the code, one by
one. For each error introduced, save and run the program, and comment
how well Matlab&#8217;s response corresponds to the actual error. When you
are finished with one error, re-set the program to correct behavior
(and check that it works!) before moving on to the next error.</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong>
Insert the word <em>hello</em> on the empty line above the assignment to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">v0</span></code>.</p>
<p><strong>Solution.</strong>
An error message is printed, which at the end states that
Error: Undefined function or variable hello
The error message tells us explicitly what is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong>
Remove the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%</span></code> sign in front of the
comment <em>initial velocity</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Solution.</strong>
An error message is printed, which states that</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>In docli(builtin) at line 1
    In base(base)
    In base()
    In global()
Error: unable to resolve initial to a function call
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Matlab gives us the line number where it detected a
problem. Matlab &#8220;is confused&#8221; and tells us that it does not
recognize the word <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">initial</span></code> as the name of a defined function.
To a beginner, this may be somewhat misleading, but at least
we know the line where the problem is.</p>
<p><strong>c)</strong>
Remove the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">=</span></code> sign in the assignment to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">v0</span></code>.</p>
<p><strong>Solution.</strong>
An error message is printed, which at the end states that</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>In docli(builtin) at line 1
    In base(base)
    In base()
    In global()
Error: unable to resolve v0 to a function call
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Matlab gives us the line number where it detected a
problem. Matlab &#8220;is confused&#8221; and tells us that it does not
recognize the word <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">v0</span></code> as the name of a defined function.
To a beginner, this may be somewhat misleading, but at least
we know the line where the problem is.</p>
<p><strong>d)</strong>
Change the symbol <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">^</span></code> into <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**</span></code>.</p>
<p><strong>Solution.</strong>
An error message is printed, stating that</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>In docli(builtin) at line 5
    In base(base)
    In base()
    In global()
Error: unable to resolve y to a function call
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Matlab gives us the line number where it detected a
problem. Matlab &#8220;is confused&#8221; and tells us that it does not
recognize the word <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span></code> as the name of a defined function.
To a beginner, this may be somewhat misleading, but at least
we know the line where the problem is.</p>
<p><strong>e)</strong>
Change the calculation of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span></code> to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">v0*t</span></code>.</p>
<p><strong>Solution.</strong>
We get no error message this time, even if the calculation of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span></code>
is wrong! This is because, to Matlab, the &#8220;new&#8221; way of calculating
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span></code> is perfectly legal, and Matlab can not know what we wanted to
compute. This is therefore another kind of error that sometimes may
be hard to find, since we get no error message. To find such errors,
answers have to be analyzed quantitatively in some way.</p>
<p><strong>f)</strong>
Write <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code> on the line just above where <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span></code> is calculated.</p>
<p><strong>Solution.</strong>
An error message is printed, which states that</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>In docli(builtin) at line 4
    In base(base)
    In base()
    In global()
Error: Undefined function or variable x
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Matlab gives us the line number where a problem was detected.
Then, it explicitly tells us the problem, namely that <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code> is
not defined.</p>
<p><strong>g)</strong>
Change the statement <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">v0*t</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">0.5*g*t^2</span></code> into <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">v0*t</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">0.5*g*t^2;</span></code>. That is, insert a semicolon at the end.</p>
<p><strong>Solution.</strong>
We get no answer from the program and no error message. This is correct,
since the semi-colon directs Matlab not to print the result to screen.
That is no error, but unfortunately we do not see what was computed and stored in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span></code>.</p>

<p>Write a program that prints four random to the screen.

Find the information needed for the task,
see for example
<a class="reference external" href="htpp://www.mathworks.com">htpp://www.mathworks.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Hint.</strong>
Matlab has a built-in function <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rand</span></code> for drawing random numbers. Try

<p><strong>Solution.</strong>
From Matlab documentation, we find that a function <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rand</span></code> will draw random
