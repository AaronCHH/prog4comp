We now turn our attention to solving mathematical problems through
computer programming. There are many reasons to choose integration as
our first application. Integration is well known already from high
school mathematics. Most integrals are not tractable by pen and paper,
and a computerized solution approach is both very much simpler and
much more powerful - you can essentially treat all integrals
:math:`\int_a^bf(x)dx` in 10 lines of computer code (!). Integration also
demonstrates the difference between exact mathematics by pen and paper
and *numerical mathematics* on a computer. The latter approaches
the result of the former without any worries about rounding errors
due to finite precision arithmetics in computers (in contrast to
differentiation, where such errors prevent us from getting a result as accurate
as we desire on the computer). Finally, integration is thought of
as a somewhat difficult mathematical concept to grasp, and programming
integration should greatly help with the understanding of what
integration is and how it works. Not only shall we understand how to
use the computer to integrate, but we shall also learn a series of
good habits to ensure your computer work is of the highest scientific
quality. In particular, we have a strong focus on how to write
Matlab code that is free of programming mistakes.

Calculating an integral is traditionally done by

.. _Eq:eqn:FbFa:

.. math::

    \tag{2}
    \int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a), 
        

where

.. math::
         f(x) = \frac{dF}{dx} \thinspace . 

The major problem with this procedure is that we need to find
the *anti-derivative* :math:`F(x)` corresponding to a given :math:`f(x)`.
For some relatively simple integrands :math:`f(x)`,
finding :math:`F(x)` is a doable task, but it can very quickly become challenging,
even impossible!

The method :ref:`(2) <Eq:eqn:FbFa>` provides an *exact* or *analytical* value
of the integral. If we relax the requirement of the integral being
exact, and instead look for *approximate* values, produced by
*numerical methods*, integration becomes a very straightforward task
for any given :math:`f(x)` (!).

The downside of a numerical method is that it can only find an
approximate answer. Leaving the exact for the approximate is a mental
barrier in the beginning, but remember that most real applications of
integration will involve an :math:`f(x)` function that contains physical
parameters, which are measured with some error. That is, :math:`f(x)` is
very seldom exact, and then it does not make sense to compute the
integral with a smaller error than the one already present in :math:`f(x)`.

Another advantage of numerical methods is that we can easily integrate
a function :math:`f(x)` that is only known as *samples*, i.e., discrete
values at some :math:`x` points, and not as a continuous function of :math:`x`
expressed through a formula.  This is highly relevant when :math:`f` is
measured in a physical experiment.

.. _sec:integrals:basic:

Basic ideas of numerical integration
====================================

We consider the integral

.. _Eq:sec:integr_fofx:

.. math::

    \tag{3}
    \int_a^b f(x)dx\thinspace .
        
        

Most numerical methods for computing this integral split
up the original integral into a sum of several integrals, each
covering a smaller part of the original integration interval
:math:`[a,b]`. This re-writing of the integral is based on a selection of
*integration points* :math:`x_i`, :math:`i = 0,1,\ldots,n` that are distributed on
the interval :math:`[a,b]`. Integration points may,
or may not, be evenly distributed. An even distribution simplifies
expressions and is often sufficient, so we will mostly restrict ourselves to
that choice. The integration points are then computed as

.. _Eq:sec:integr_points:

.. math::

    \tag{4}
    x_i = a + ih,\quad i = 0,1,\ldots,n,
        
        

where

.. _Eq:sec:h_intgr_step:

.. math::

    \tag{5}
    h = \frac{b-a}{n}\thinspace .
        
        

Given the integration points, the original
integral is re-written as a sum of integrals, each integral being
computed over the sub-interval between two consecutive integration
points. The integral in :ref:`(3) <Eq:sec:integr_fofx>` is thus expressed as

.. _Eq:eqfdx:

.. math::

    \tag{6}
    \int_a^b f(x)dx =
        \int_{x_0}^{x_1} f(x)dx + \int_{x_1}^{x_2} f(x)dx + \ldots +
        \int_{x_{n-1}}^{x_n} f(x)dx\thinspace .
        
        

Note that :math:`x_0 = a` and :math:`x_n = b`.

Proceeding from :ref:`(6) <Eq:eqfdx>`, the different integration methods will
differ in the way they approximate each integral on the right hand
side.  The fundamental idea is that each term is an integral over a
small interval :math:`[x_i,x_{i+1}]`, and over this small interval, it makes
sense to approximate :math:`f` by a simple shape, say a constant, a straight
line, or a parabola, which we can easily integrate by hand. The
details will become clear in the coming examples.

Computational example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To understand and compare the numerical integration methods, it is
advantageous to use a specific integral for computations and graphical
illustrations. In particular, we want to use an integral that we can
calculate by hand such that the accuracy of the approximation methods
can easily be assessed.  Our specific integral is taken from basic
physics.  Assume that you speed up your car from rest and wonder how
far you go in :math:`T` seconds. The distance is given by the integral
:math:`\int_0^T v(t)dt`, where :math:`v(t)` is the velocity as a function of
time. A rapidly increasing velocity function might be

.. _Eq:sec:vCar_foft:

.. math::

    \tag{7}
    v\left(t\right) = 3t^{2}e^{t^3}\thinspace .
        
        

The distance after one second is

.. _Eq:sec:dCar_intgr:

.. math::

    \tag{8}
    \int_0^1 v(t)dt,
        
        

which is the integral we aim to compute by numerical methods.
Fortunately, the chosen expression of the velocity has a form that makes it
easy to calculate the anti-derivative as

.. _Eq:sec:pCar_Foft:

.. math::

    \tag{9}
    V(t) = e^{t^3}-1\thinspace .
        
        

We can therefore compute the exact value of the integral as
:math:`V(1)-V(0)\approx 1.718` (rounded to 3 decimals for convenience).

.. _sec:integrals:trap:

The composite trapezoidal rule
==============================

.. index:: Trapezoidal rule

.. index:: composite trapezoidal rule

The integral :math:`\int_a^b f(x)dx` may be interpreted as the
area between the :math:`x` axis and the graph :math:`y=f(x)` of the integrand.
Figure :ref:`fig:vCar` illustrates this area for the choice
:ref:`(8) <Eq:sec:dCar_intgr>`. Computing the integral :math:`\int_0^1f(t)dt`
amounts to computing the area of the hatched region.

.. _fig:vCar:

.. figure:: integral_of_f.png
   :width: 400

   The integral of :math:`v(t)` interpreted as the area under the graph of :math:`v`

.. index::
   single: integration; points

If we *replace* the true graph in Figure :ref:`fig:vCar` by a set of
straight line segments, we may view the area rather as composed of
trapezoids, the areas of which are easy to compute. This is
illustrated in Figure :ref:`fig:vCarTrapeze`, where 4 straight line
segments give rise to 4 trapezoids, covering the time intervals
:math:`[0,0.2)`, :math:`[0.2,0.6)`, :math:`[0.6,0.8)` and :math:`[0.8,1.0]`. Note that we have
taken the opportunity here to demonstrate the computations with time
intervals that differ in size.

.. _fig:vCarTrapeze:

.. figure:: viz_trapezoidal.png
   :width: 400

   *Computing approximately the integral of a function as the sum of the areas of the trapezoids*

The areas of the 4 trapezoids shown in Figure :ref:`fig:vCarTrapeze`
now constitute our approximation to the integral
:ref:`(8) <Eq:sec:dCar_intgr>`:

.. math::
        
        \int_0^1 v(t)dt \approx
        h_1 (\frac{v(0)+v(0.2)}{2}) + h_2 (\frac{v(0.2)+v(0.6)}{2}) \nonumber  
        

.. _Eq:sec:integr_Trap_split:

.. math::

    \tag{10}
    + h_3 (\frac{v(0.6)+v(0.8)}{2}) + h_4 (\frac{v(0.8)+v(1.0)}{2}),
        
        

where

.. _Eq:sec:integr_h1:

.. math::

    \tag{11}
    h_1 = (0.2 - 0.0),
          
        

.. _Eq:sec:integr_h2:

.. math::

    \tag{12}
    h_2 = (0.6 - 0.2),
          
        

.. _Eq:sec:integr_h3:

.. math::

    \tag{13}
    h_3 = (0.8 - 0.6),
          
        

.. _Eq:sec:integr_h4:

.. math::

    \tag{14}
    h_4 = (1.0 - 0.8)\thinspace
        
        

With :math:`v(t) = 3t^{2}e^{t^3}`, each term in :ref:`(10) <Eq:sec:integr_Trap_split>` is readily computed and our approximate computation gives

.. _Eq:sec:integr_Trap_answer:

.. math::

    \tag{15}
    \int_0^1 v(t)dt \approx 1.895\thinspace .
        
        

Compared to the true answer of :math:`1.718`, this is off by about
10%. However, note that we used just 4 trapezoids to approximate the
area. With more trapezoids, the approximation would have become
better, since the straight line segments in the upper trapezoid side
then would follow the graph more closely. Doing another hand
calculation with more trapezoids is not too tempting for a lazy human,
though, but it is a perfect job for a computer! Let us therefore
derive the expressions for approximating the integral
by an arbitrary number of trapezoids.

.. _sec:integrals:formula:

The general formula          (1)
--------------------------------

For a given function :math:`f(x)`, we want to approximate the
integral :math:`\int_a^bf(x)dx` by :math:`n` trapezoids (of equal width). We start out with
:ref:`(6) <Eq:eqfdx>` and approximate each integral on the right hand side
with a single trapezoid. In detail,

.. math::
        
        \int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \int_{x_0}^{x_1} f(x) dx + \int_{x_1}^{x_2} f(x) dx + \ldots + \int_{x_{n-1}}^{x_n} f(x) dx,     \nonumber 
        

.. math::
          
                          \approx h \frac{f(x_0) + f(x_1)}{2} +
        		  h \frac{f(x_1) + f(x_2)}{2} + \ldots + \nonumber 
        

.. _Eq:eqfdelta:

.. math::

    \tag{16}
    \quad h \frac{f(x_{n-1}) + f(x_n)}{2} 
        

By simplifying the right hand side of :ref:`(16) <Eq:eqfdelta>` we get

.. _Eq:eqn:314:

.. math::

    \tag{17}
    \int_a^b f(x)\,dx \approx \\ 
        \frac{h}{2}\left[f(x_0) + 2 f(x_1) + 2 f(x_2) + \ldots + 2 f(x_{n-1}) + f(x_n)\right]              
        

which is more compactly written as

.. _Eq:eqn:315:

.. math::

    \tag{18}
    \int_a^b f(x)\,dx \approx h \left[\frac{1}{2}f(x_0) + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}f(x_i) + \frac{1}{2}f(x_n) \right] \thinspace .
        
        


.. admonition:: Composite integration rules

   The word *composite* is often used when a numerical integration method
   is applied with more than one sub-interval. Strictly speaking then,
   writing, e.g., "the trapezoidal method", should imply the use of
   only a single trapezoid, while "the composite trapezoidal method" is
   the most correct name when several trapezoids are used.  However, this
   naming convention is not always followed, so saying just "the
   trapezoidal method" may point to a single trapezoid as well as the
   composite rule with many trapezoids.




.. _sec:integrals:trap:impl:

Implementation          (1)
---------------------------

Specific or general implementation?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   single: implementation; specific

.. index::
   single: implementation; general

Suppose our primary goal was to compute the specific integral
:math:`\int_0^1 v(t)dt` with :math:`v(t)=3t^2e^{t^3}`. First we played around with
a simple hand calculation to see what the method was about, before we
(as one often does in mathematics) developed a general formula
:ref:`(18) <Eq:eqn:315>` for the general or "abstract" integral
:math:`\int_a^bf(x)dx`.  To solve our specific problem :math:`\int_0^1 v(t)dt` we
must then apply the general formula :ref:`(18) <Eq:eqn:315>` to the given data
(function and integral limits) in our problem.  Although simple in
principle, the practical steps are confusing for many because the
notation in the abstract problem in :ref:`(18) <Eq:eqn:315>` differs from the
notation in our special problem.  Clearly, the :math:`f`, :math:`x`, and :math:`h` in
:ref:`(18) <Eq:eqn:315>` correspond to :math:`v`, :math:`t`, and perhaps :math:`\Delta t` for the
trapezoid width in our special problem.


.. admonition:: The programmer's dilemma

   1. Should we write a special program for the special integral,
      using the ideas from the general rule :ref:`(18) <Eq:eqn:315>`, but
      replacing :math:`f` by :math:`v`, :math:`x` by :math:`t`, and :math:`h` by :math:`\Delta t`?
   
   2. Should we implement the general method :ref:`(18) <Eq:eqn:315>` as it stands in a
      general function ``trapezoid(f, a, b, n)`` and solve the specific
      problem at hand by a specialized call to this function?
   
   **Alternative 2 is always the best choice!**




The first alternative in the box above sounds less abstract and
therefore more attractive to many. Nevertheless, as we hope will be
evident from the examples, the second alternative is actually the
simplest *and* most reliable from both a mathematical and programming
point of view. These authors will claim that the second alternative
is the essence of the power of mathematics, while the first alternative
is the source of much confusion about mathematics!

Implementation with functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the integral :math:`\int_a^bf(x)dx` computed by the formula
:ref:`(18) <Eq:eqn:315>` we want the corresponding Matlab function ``trapezoid``
to take any :math:`f`, :math:`a`, :math:`b`, and :math:`n` as input and return the
approximation to the integral.

We write a Matlab function ``trapezoidal``
in a file `trapezoidal.m <https://github.com/hplgit/prog4comp/tree/master/src/m/trapezoidal.m>`__
as close as possible
to the formula :ref:`(18) <Eq:eqn:315>`, making sure variable names correspond
to the mathematical notation:

.. code-block:: matlab

        function integral = trapezoidal(f, a, b, n)
            h = (b-a)/n;
            result = 0.5*f(a) + 0.5*f(b);
            for i = 1:(n-1)
                result = result + f(a + i*h);
            end
            integral = h*result;
        end

This function must be placed in a file ``trapezoidal.m`` to be
reused in other programs and in interactive sessions.

Solving our specific problem in a session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An interactive session can make use of the ``trapezoidal`` function
in ``trapezoidal.m`` to solve our particular problem :math:`\int_0^1v(t)dt`:

.. code-block:: text

        octave:1> v = @(t) 3*(t^2)*exp(t^3);
        octave:2> n = 4;
        octave:4> numerical = trapezoidal(v, 0, 1, n);
        octave:5> numerical
        numerical =  1.9227

Let us compute the exact expression and the error in the approximation:

.. code-block:: text

        octave:6> V = @(t) exp(t^3);
        octave:7> exact = V(1) - V(0);
        octave:8> error = exact - numerical
        ans = -0.20443

Is this error convincing? We can try a larger :math:`n`:

.. code-block:: text

        octave:9> numerical = trapezoidal(v, 0, 1, 400);
        octave:10> exact - numerical
        ans = -2.1236e-05

Fortunately, many more trapezoids give a much smaller error.

Solving our specific problem in a program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of computing our special problem in an interactive session,
we can do it in a program. As always, a chunk of code doing a
particular thing is best isolated as a function even if we do
not see any future reason to call the function several times and
even if we have no need for arguments to parameterize what goes
on inside the function. In the present case, we just put the
statements we otherwise would have put in a main program, inside
a function:

.. code-block:: matlab

        function application()
          v = @(t) 3*(t^2)*exp(t^3);
          n = input('n: ')
          numerical = trapezoidal(v, 0, 1, n);
        
          % Compare with exact result
          V = @(t) exp(t^3);
          exact = V(1) - V(0);
          error = exact - numerical;
          fprintf("n=%d: %.16f, error: %g", n, numerical, error)
        end

Now we compute our special problem by calling ``application()`` as
the only statement in the main program.
The ``application`` function and its call is in the file
``trapezoidal_app.m``, which can be run as

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> octave trapezoidal_app.m
        ...
        n: 4
        n =  4
        n=4: 1.9227167504675762, error: -0.204435

Alternative flat special-purpose implementation
-----------------------------------------------

.. index::
   single: code; re-use

.. index:: flat program

.. index::
   single: program; flat

Let us illustrate the implementation implied by alternative 1
in the *Programmer's dilemma* box in the section :ref:`sec:integrals:trap:impl`.
That is, we make a special-purpose code where we adapt the
general formula :ref:`(18) <Eq:eqn:315>`
to the specific problem :math:`\int_0^1 3t^2e^{t^3}dt`.

Basically, we use a ``for`` loop to compute the sum. Each term with :math:`f(x)` in
the formula :ref:`(18) <Eq:eqn:315>` is replaced by :math:`3t^2e^{t^3}`, :math:`x` by :math:`t`,
and :math:`h` by :math:`\Delta t` [#deltat-replacement]_. A first try at writing a plain,
flat program doing the special calculation is

.. code-block:: matlab

        a = 0.0;  b = 1.0;
        n = input('n: ')
        dt = (b-a)/n;
        
        % Integral by the trapezoidal method
        numerical = 0.5*3*(a^2)*exp(a^3) + 0.5*3*(b^2)*exp(b^3);
        for i = 1:(n-1)
            numerical = numerical + 3*((a + i*dt)^2)*exp((a + i*dt)^3);
        end
        numerical = numerical*dt;
        
        exact_value = exp(1^3) - exp(0^3);
        error = exact_value - numerical;
        fprintf('n=%d: %.16f, error: %g', n, numerical, error);

.. [#deltat-replacement] Replacing :math:`h` by :math:`\Delta t` is not strictly
   required as many use :math:`h` as interval also along the time axis.
   Nevertheless, :math:`\Delta t` is an even more popular notation for
   a small time interval, so we adopt that common notation.

The problem with the above code is at least three-fold:

1. We need to reformulate :ref:`(18) <Eq:eqn:315>` for our special
   problem with a different notation.

2. The integrand :math:`3t^2e^{t^3}` is inserted many times in the
   code, which quickly leads to errors.

3. A lot of edits are necessary to use the code to compute a different
   integral - these edits are likely to introduce errors.

The potential errors involved in point 2 serve to illustrate how important it is to use Matlab functions as mathematical functions. Here we have chosen to use the lambda function to define the integrand as the variable ``v``:

.. code-block:: matlab

        v = @(t) 3*(t^2)*exp(t^3);
        
        a = 0.0;  b = 1.0;
        n = input('n: ')
        dt = (b-a)/n;
        
        % Integral by the trapezoidal method
        numerical = 0.5*v(a) + 0.5*v(b);
        for i = 1:(n-1)
            numerical = numerical + v(a + i*dt);
        end
        numerical = numerical*dt;
        
        F = @(t) exp(t^3);
        exact_value = F(b) - F(a);
        error = exact_value - numerical;
        fprintf('n=%d: %.16f, error: %g', n, numerical, error);

Unfortunately, the two other problems remain and they are fundamental.

Suppose you want to compute another integral, say :math:`\int_{-1}^{1.1}e^{-x^2}dx`.
How much do we need to change in the previous code
to compute the new integral? Not so much:

 * the formula for ``v`` must be replaced by a new formula

 * the limits ``a`` and ``b``

 * the anti-derivative :math:`V` is not easily known [#erf]_ and can be omitted,
   and therefore we cannot write out the error

 * the notation should be changed to be aligned with the new problem, i.e.,
   ``t`` and ``dt`` changed to ``x`` and ``h``

.. [#erf] You cannot integrate :math:`e^{-x^2}` by hand, but this particular
   integral is appearing so often in so many contexts that the integral
   is a special function, called the `Error function <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_function>`__ and written :math:`\mbox{erf}(x)`. In a code, you can
   call ``erf(x)``.

.. index::
   single: error; function (erf)

These changes are straightforward to implement, but *they are scattered
around in the program*, a fact that requires us to be very careful so
we do not introduce new programming errors while we modify the code.
It is also very easy to forget to make a required change.

With the previous code in ``trapezoidal.m``, we can compute
the new integral :math:`\int_{-1}^{1.1}e^{-x^2}dx` *without touching
the mathematical algorithm*. In an interactive session (or
in a program) we can just do

.. code-block:: text

        octave:1> trapezoidal(@(x) exp(-x^2), -1, 1.1, 400)
        ans =  1.5269

When you now look back at the two solutions, the flat special-purpose
program and the function-based program with the general-purpose
function ``trapezoidal``, you hopefully realize that *implementing
a general mathematical algorithm in a general function* requires
somewhat more abstract thinking, but the resulting code can be
used over and over again. Essentially, if you apply the flat
special-purpose style, you have to retest the implementation of
the algorithm after every change of the program.

The present integral problems result in short code.
In more challenging engineering problems the code quickly grows
to hundreds and thousands of line. Without abstractions in terms
of general algorithms in general reusable functions, the complexity
of the program grows so fast that it will be extremely difficult
to make sure that the program works properly.

Another advantage of packaging mathematical algorithms in functions
is that a function can be reused by anyone to solve
a problem by just calling the function with a proper set of arguments.
Understanding the function's
inner details is not necessary to compute a new integral. Similarly,
you can find libraries of functions on the Internet and use these
functions to solve your problems without specific knowledge of
every mathematical detail in the functions.

This desirable feature has its downside, of course: the user of a
function may misuse it, and the function may contain programming
errors and lead to wrong answers. Testing the output of downloaded
functions is therefore extremely important before relying on the
results.

The composite midpoint method
=============================

The idea
~~~~~~~~

Rather than approximating the area under a curve by trapezoids, we can
use plain rectangles. It may sound less accurate to use horizontal lines
and not skew lines following the function to be integrated, but
an integration method based on rectangles (the *midpoint method*) is in fact slightly more
accurate than the one based on trapezoids!

In the midpoint method, we construct a rectangle for every sub-interval
where the height equals :math:`f` at the midpoint of the sub-interval.
Let us do this for four rectangles, using the same sub-intervals as we
had for hand calculations with the trapezoidal method:
:math:`[0,0.2)`, :math:`[0.2,0.6)`, :math:`[0.6,0.8)`, and :math:`[0.8,1.0]`. We get

.. math::
        
        \int_0^1 f(t)dt \approx
           h_1 f\left(\frac{0 + 0.2}{2}\right) +
           h_2 f\left(\frac{0.2 + 0.6}{2}\right) \nonumber  
        

.. _Eq:sec:integr_Midp_split:

.. math::

    \tag{19}
    + h_3 f\left(\frac{0.6 + 0.8}{2}\right) +
           h_4 f\left(\frac{0.8 + 1.0}{2}\right),
        
        

where :math:`h_1`, :math:`h_2`, :math:`h_3`, and :math:`h_4` are the widths of the sub-intervals,
used previously with the trapezoidal method and defined in
:ref:`(11) <Eq:sec:integr_h1>`-:ref:`(14) <Eq:sec:integr_h4>`.

   :width: 400

   *Computing approximately the integral of a function as the sum of the areas of the rectangles*

With :math:`f(t) = 3t^{2}e^{t^3}`, the approximation becomes :math:`1.632`.
Compared with the true answer (:math:`1.718`), this is about :math:`5\%` too
small, but it is better than what we got with the trapezoidal method
(:math:`10\%`) with the same sub-intervals. More rectangles give a
better approximation.

The general formula          (2)
--------------------------------

Let us derive a formula for the midpoint method based on :math:`n` rectangles of equal width:

.. math::
        
        \int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \int_{x_0}^{x_1} f(x)dx + \int_{x_1}^{x_2} f(x)dx +
                             \ldots + \int_{x_{n-1}}^{x_n} f(x)dx,     \nonumber 
        

.. _Eq:sec:Midp_general1:

.. math::

    \tag{20}
    \approx h f\left(\frac{x_0 + x_1}{2}\right) +
                           h f\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}\right) + \ldots +
                           h f\left(\frac{x_{n-1} + x_n}{2}\right) ,
          
        

.. _Eq:sec:Midp_general2:

.. math::

    \tag{21}
    \approx h \left(f\left(\frac{x_0 + x_1}{2}\right) +
                          f\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}\right) + \ldots +
                          f\left(\frac{x_{n-1} + x_n}{2}\right)\right)\thinspace .
        
        

This sum may be written more compactly as

.. _Eq:sec:midpointFormula:

.. math::

    \tag{22}
    \int_a^b f(x) dx \approx h \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}f(x_i) ,
        
        

where :math:`x_i = \left(a + \frac{h}{2}\right) + ih`.

.. _sec:midpoint:code:

Implementation          (2)
---------------------------

We follow the advice and lessons learned from the implementation of
the trapezoidal method and make a function ``midpoint(f, a, b, n)``
(in a file `midpoint.m <https://github.com/hplgit/prog4comp/tree/master/src/m/midpoint.m>`__)
for implementing the general formula :ref:`(22) <Eq:sec:midpointFormula>`:

.. code-block:: matlab

        function result_integration = midpoint(f, a, b, n)
            h = (b-a)/n;
            result = 0;
            for i = 0:(n-1)
                result = result + f((a + h/2) + i*h);
            end
            result_integration = h*result;
        end

We can test the function as we explained for the similar ``trapezoidal``
method. The error in our particular problem :math:`\int_0^1 3t^2e^{t^3}dt`
with four intervals is now about 0.1 in contrast to 0.2 for the
trapezoidal rule.  This is in fact not accidental: one can show
mathematically that the error of the midpoint method is a bit smaller
than for the trapezoidal method. The differences are seldom of any
practical importance, and on a laptop we can easily use :math:`n=10^6` and
get the answer with an error about :math:`10^{-12}` in a couple of seconds.

Comparing the trapezoidal and the midpoint methods
--------------------------------------------------

The next example shows how easy we can combine the ``trapezoidal`` and ``midpoint``
functions to make a comparison of the two methods in the
file
`compare_integration_methods.m <https://github.com/hplgit/prog4comp/tree/master/src/m/compare_integration_methods.m>`__:

.. code-block:: matlab

        g = @(y) exp(-y^2);
        a = 0;
        b = 2;
        fprintf('    n        midpoint          trapezoidal\n');
        for i = 1:20
            n = 2^i;
            m = midpoint(g, a, b, n);
            t = trapezoidal(g, a, b, n);
            fprintf('%7d %.16f %.16f\n', n, m, t);
        end

Note the efforts put into nice formatting - the output becomes

A visual inspection of the numbers shows how fast the digits
stabilize in both methods. It appears that 13 digits have stabilized
in the last two rows.

.. index:: Simpson's rule

.. index:: Gauss quadrature


.. admonition:: Remark

   The trapezoidal and midpoint methods are just two examples in a jungle
   of numerical integration rules. Other famous methods are
   Simpson's rule and Gauss quadrature. They all work in the same way:
   
   .. math::
            \int_a^b f(x)dx \approx \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} w_if(x_i)\thinspace .
   
   That is, the integral is approximated by a sum of function
   evaluations, where each evaluation :math:`f(x_i)` is given a weight :math:`w_i`.
   The different methods differ in the way they construct the
   evaluation points :math:`x_i` and the weights :math:`w_i`.
   We have used equally spaced points :math:`x_i`, but higher accuracy can be
   obtained by optimizing the location of :math:`x_i`.




Testing
=======

Problems with brief testing procedures
--------------------------------------

Testing of the programs for numerical integration has so far employed
two strategies. If we have an exact answer, we compute the error and
see that increasing :math:`n` decreases the error. When the exact answer is
not available, we can (as in the comparison example in the previous
section) look at the integral values and see that they stabilize as
:math:`n` grows. Unfortunately, these are very weak test procedures and not
at all satisfactory for claiming that the software we have produced is
correctly implemented.

.. index:: bug

To see this, we can introduce a bug in the
``application`` function that calls ``trapezoidal``: instead of
integrating :math:`3t^2e^{t^3}`, we write "accidentally" :math:`3t^3e^{t^3}`,
but keep the same anti-derivative :math:`V(t)e^{t^3}` for computing the
error.  With the bug and :math:`n=4`, the error is 0.1, but without the bug
the error is 0.2!  It is of course completely impossible to tell if
0.1 is the right value of the error. Fortunately, increasing :math:`n` shows
that the error stays about 0.3 in the program with the bug, so
the test procedure with increasing :math:`n` and checking that the error
decreases points to a problem in the code.

Let us look at another bug, this time in the mathematical algorithm:
instead of computing :math:`\frac{1}{2}(f(a) + f(b))` as we should, we
forget the second :math:`\frac{1}{2}` and write ``0.5*f(a) + f(b)``.  The error for
:math:`n=4,40,400` when computing
:math:`\int_{1.1}^{1.9} 3t^2e^{t^3}dt` goes like :math:`1400`, :math:`107`, :math:`10`,
respectively, which looks promising.  The problem is that
the right errors should be :math:`369`, :math:`4.08`, and
:math:`0.04`. That is, the error should be reduced faster in the
correct than in the buggy code. The problem, however, is that it is
reduced in both codes, and we may stop further testing and believe
everything is correctly implemented.

.. index:: unit tests


.. admonition:: Unit testing

   A good habit is to test small pieces of a larger code individually, one at a time.
   This is known as *unit testing*. One identifies a (small) unit of
   the code, and then one makes a separate test for this unit. The unit test
   should be stand-alone in the sense that it can be run without the
   outcome of other tests. Typically, one algorithm
   in scientific programs is considered as a unit. The challenge
   with unit tests in numerical computing is to deal with numerical
   approximation errors. A fortunate side effect of unit testing is that
   the programmer is forced to use functions to modularize the code into smaller,
   logical pieces.




.. _sec:integrals:testprocs:

Proper test procedures
----------------------

.. index:: testing procedures

There are three serious ways to test the implementation of
numerical methods via unit tests:

1. *Comparing with hand-computed results* in a problem with
   few arithmetic operations, i.e., small :math:`n`.

2. *Solving a problem without numerical errors*. We know that the trapezoidal
   rule must be exact for linear functions. The error produced
   by the program must then be zero (to machine precision).

3. *Demonstrating correct convergence rates*. A strong test when we can
   compute exact errors, is to see how fast the error goes
   to zero as :math:`n` grows. In the trapezoidal and midpoint rules
   it is known that the error depends on :math:`n` as :math:`n^{-2}` as
   :math:`n\rightarrow\infty`.

Hand-computed results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us use two trapezoids and compute the integral :math:`\int_0^1v(t)`,
:math:`v(t)=3t^2e^{t^3}`:

.. math::
         \frac{1}{2}h(v(0) + v(0.5)) + \frac{1}{2}h(v(0.5)+v(1)) = 2.463642041244344,

when :math:`h=0.5` is the width of the two trapezoids. Running the program
gives exactly the same results.

Solving a problem without numerical errors          (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best unit tests for numerical algorithms involve mathematical
problems where we know the numerical result beforehand. Usually,
numerical results contain unknown approximation errors, so knowing the
numerical result implies that we have a problem where the
approximation errors vanish. This feature may be present in very
simple mathematical problems. For example, the trapezoidal method is
exact for integration of linear functions :math:`f(x)=ax+b`. We can
therefore pick some linear function and construct a test function that
checks equality between the exact analytical expression for the
integral and the number computed by the implementation of the
trapezoidal method.

A specific test case can be :math:`\int_{1.2}^{4.4} (6x-4)dx`. This
integral involves an "arbitrary" interval  :math:`[1.2, 4.4]` and
an "arbitrary" linear function :math:`f(x) = 6x-4`. By "arbitrary"
we mean expressions where we avoid the special numbers 0 and 1 since
these have special properties in arithmetic operations (e.g.,
forgetting to multiply is equivalent to multiplying by 1, and
forgetting to add is equivalent to adding 0).

Demonstrating correct convergence rates          (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index:: convergence rate

.. index:: rate of convergence

.. index::
   single: error; asymptotic

Normally, unit tests must be based on problems where the numerical
approximation errors in our implementation remain unknown. However, we
often know or may assume a certain *asymptotic* behavior of the error.
We can do some experimental runs with the test problem :math:`\int_0^1
3t^2e^{t^3}dt` where :math:`n` is doubled in each run: :math:`n=4,8,16`. The
corresponding errors are then 12%, 3% and 0.77%, respectively. These
numbers indicate that the error is roughly reduced by a factor of 4
when doubling :math:`n`. Thus, the error converges to zero as :math:`n^{-2}` and
we say that the *convergence rate* is 2. In
fact, this result can also be shown mathematically for the trapezoidal
and midpoint method.  Numerical integration methods usually have an error
that converge to zero as :math:`n^{-p}` for some :math:`p` that depends on the
method. With such a result, it does not matter if we do not know what
the actual approximation error is: we know at what rate it is
*reduced*, so running the implementation for two or more different :math:`n`
values will put us in a position to measure the expected rate and see if
it is achieved.

The idea of a corresponding unit test is then to run the algorithm for some :math:`n` values,
compute the error (the absolute value of the difference between the
exact analytical result and the one produced by the numerical method),
and check that the error has *approximately* correct asymptotic
behavior, i.e., that the error is proportional to :math:`n^{-2}` in case of
the trapezoidal and midpoint method.

Let us develop a more precise method for such unit tests based on
convergence rates.  We assume that the error :math:`E` depends on :math:`n`
according to

.. math::
         E = Cn^r,

where :math:`C` is an unknown constant and :math:`r` is the convergence rate.
Consider a set of experiments with various :math:`n`:
:math:`n_1, n_2, \ldots,n_q`.
We compute the corresponding errors
:math:`E_1,\ldots,E_q`.
For two consecutive experiments, number :math:`i` and :math:`i-1`,
we have the error model

.. _Eq:_auto2:

.. math::

    \tag{23}
    E_{i} = Cn_{i}^r,
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto3:

.. math::

    \tag{24}
    E_{i-1} = Cn_{i-1}^r\thinspace .
        
        

These are two equations for two unknowns :math:`C` and :math:`r`.
We can easily eliminate :math:`C` by dividing the equations by each other.
Then solving for :math:`r` gives

.. _Eq:sec:integrals:testprocs:req:

.. math::

    \tag{25}
    r_i = \frac{\ln (E_i/E_{i-1})}{\ln (n_i/n_{i-1})}\thinspace .
        
        

We have introduced a subscript :math:`i` in :math:`r`
since the estimated
value for :math:`r` varies with :math:`i`. Hopefully,
:math:`r_i` approaches
the correct convergence rate as the number of intervals increases
and :math:`i\rightarrow q`.

.. _sec:integrals:finite_prec:

Finite precision of floating-point numbers
------------------------------------------

.. index:: finite precision (of float)

The test procedures above lead to comparison of numbers for checking that
calculations were correct.
Such comparison is more complicated than what a newcomer might think.
Suppose we have a calculation ``a + b`` and want to check that the
result is what we expect. We start with 1 + 2:

.. code-block:: matlab

        >> a = 1; b = 2; expected = 3;
        >> a + b == expected
        ans =  1

Then we proceed with 0.1 + 0.2:

.. code-block:: matlab

        >> a = 0.1; b = 0.2; expected = 0.3;
        >> a + b == expected
        ans = 0

.. index:: floating point number (float)

So why is :math:`0.1 + 0.2 \neq 0.3`? The reason is that real numbers cannot in
general be exactly represented on a computer. They must instead be
approximated by a `floating-point number <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point>`__ that can only store a finite amount of information, usually about
17 digits of a real number. Let us print 0.1, 0.2, 0.1 + 0.2, and 0.3
with 17 decimals:

.. code-block:: matlab

        >> fprintf('%.17f\n%.17f\n%.17f\n%.17f\n', 0.1, 0.2, 0.1 + 0.2, 0.3)
        0.10000000000000001
        0.20000000000000001
        0.30000000000000004
        0.29999999999999999

We see that all of the numbers have an inaccurate digit in the 17th
decimal place. Because 0.1 + 0.2 evaluates to 0.30000000000000004
and 0.3 is represented as 0.29999999999999999, these two numbers
are not equal. In general, real numbers in Matlab have (at most)
16 correct decimals.

.. index::
   single: error; rounding

.. index::
   single: error; tolerance

When we compute with real numbers, these numbers are inaccurately
represented on the computer, and arithmetic operations with inaccurate
numbers lead to small rounding errors in the final results. Depending on
the type of numerical algorithm, the rounding errors may or may not
accumulate.

If we cannot make tests like ``0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3``, what should we then do?
The answer is that we must accept some small inaccuracy and make
a test with a *tolerance*. Here is the recipe:

.. code-block:: matlab

        >> a = 0.1; b = 0.2; expected = 0.3;
        >> computed = a + b;
        >> diff = abs(expected - computed);
        >> tol = 1E-15;
        >> diff < tol
        ans =  1

Here we have set the tolerance for comparison to :math:`10^{-15}`, but
calculating ``0.3 - (0.1 + 0.2)`` shows that it equals
``-5.55e-17``, so a lower tolerance
could be used in this particular example. However, in other calculations
we have little idea about how accurate the answer is (there could be
accumulation of rounding errors in more complicated algorithms),
so :math:`10^{-15}` or :math:`10^{-14}` are robust values.
As we demonstrate below, these tolerances depend on the magnitude of
the numbers in the calculations.

.. index::
   single: difference; absolute

.. index::
   single: difference; relative

Doing an experiment with :math:`10^k + 0.3 - (10^k + 0.1 + 0.2)` for
:math:`k=1,\ldots,10` shows that the answer (which should be zero)
is around :math:`10^{16-k}`. This means that the tolerance must be larger
if we compute with larger numbers. Setting a proper tolerance therefore
requires some experiments to see what level of accuracy one can expect.
A way out of this difficulty is to work with *relative* instead of
*absolute* differences. In a relative difference we divide by one of
the operands, e.g.,

.. math::
         a = 10^k + 0.3,\quad b = (10^k + 0.1 + 0.2),\quad c = \frac{a - b}{a}\thinspace .

Computing this :math:`c` for various :math:`k` shows a value around :math:`10^{-16}`.
A safer procedure is thus to use *relative differences*.

.. _sec:integrals:test:functions:

Constructing unit tests and writing test functions
--------------------------------------------------

.. index:: assert (function)

.. index::
   single: function; assert

Software testing in other languages often applies comprehensive test
frameworks to automatically run through large numbers of tests.
This is very
advantageous as one can at any time check that the code works.
It is a good habit to run the test suite after every edit of the
source code files.

.. index:: test function

Matlab also has test frameworks, but we shall here just use
the common ideas (across languages) for writing tests and not
employ any particular framework for running the tests. Our
convention is to put each test in a separate *test function*,
with the following properties:

 * the name must start with ``test_``

 * the test function cannot have any arguments

 * the tests inside test functions must be boolean expressions

 * a boolean expression ``b`` must be tested with ``assert(b, msg)``,
   where ``msg`` is an optional object (string or number) to be written out
   when ``b`` is false

Suppose we have written a function

.. code-block:: matlab

        function u = add(a, b)
            u = a + b;
        end

A corresponding test function might then be

.. code-block:: matlab

        function test_add
          expected = 1 + 1;
          computed = add(1, 1);
          assert(computed == expected, '1+1=%g', computed);
        end

Test functions and their calls are conveniently placed in files whose
names start with ``test_``. A simple script can be made to search for
such files and run them automatically (essentially, this is what
testing frameworks do).

As long as we add integers, the equality test in the ``test_add``
function is appropriate, but if we try to call ``add(0.1, 0.2)``
instead, we will face the rounding error problems explained in
the section :ref:`sec:integrals:finite_prec`, and we must use a test
with tolerance instead:

.. code-block:: matlab

        function test_add
          expected = 0.3;
          computed = add(0.1, 0.2;
          tol = 1E-14;
          diff = abs(expected - computed);
          assert(diff < tol, 'diff=%g', diff);
        end

Below we shall write test functions for each of the three test
procedures we suggested: comparison with hand calculations,
checking problems that can be exactly solved, and checking convergence
rates. We stick to testing the trapezoidal integration code and collect all
test functions in one common file by the name ``test_trapezoidal.m``.

In Matlab, we need to enforce the following rules on files for the function
to be tested and the test functions:

 * The numerical method (to be tested)
   must be available as a function in a file with the
   same name as the function.

 * The test functions are put in separate files.

Hand-computed numerical results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our previous hand calculations for two trapezoids can be checked against
the ``trapezoidal`` function inside a test function
(in a file `test_trapezoidal.m <https://github.com/hplgit/prog4comp/tree/master/src/m/test_trapezoidal.m>`__):

.. code-block:: matlab

        function test_trapezoidal_one_exact_result
          % Compare one hand-computed result
          v = @(t) 3*(t^2)*exp(t^3);
          n = 2;
          computed = trapezoidal(v, 0, 1, n);
          expected = 2.463642041244344;
          error = abs(expected - computed);
          tol = 1E-14;
          assert(error < tol, 'error=%g > tol=%g', error, tol);
        end

Note the importance of checking ``err`` against ``exact`` with a tolerance:
rounding errors from the arithmetics inside ``trapezoidal`` will not
make the result exactly like the hand-computed one. The size of
the tolerance is here set to :math:`10^{-14}`, which is a kind of all-round
value for computations with numbers not deviating much from unity.

Solving a problem without numerical errors          (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We know that the trapezoidal rule is exact for linear integrands.
Choosing the integral :math:`\int_{1.2}^{4.4} (6x-4)dx` as test case,
the corresponding
test function for this unit test may look like

.. code-block:: matlab

        function test_trapezoidal_linear
          % Check that linear functions are integrated exactly
          f = @(x) 6*x - 4;
          F = @(x) 3*x^2 - 4*x;  % Anti-derivative
          a = 1.2; b = 4.4;
          expected = F(b) - F(a);
          tol = 1E-14;
          for n = [2 20 21]
            computed = trapezoidal(f, a, b, n);
            error = abs(expected - computed);
            assert(error < tol, 'n=%d, err=%g', n, error);
          end
        end

Demonstrating correct convergence rates          (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the present example with integration, it is known that the
approximation errors in the trapezoidal rule are proportional to
:math:`n^{-2}`, :math:`n` being the number of subintervals used in the composite
rule.

Computing convergence rates requires somewhat more tedious programming than
the previous tests, but can be applied to more general integrands.
The algorithm typically goes like

 * for :math:`i=1,2,\ldots,q`

   * :math:`n_i = 2^i`

   * Compute integral with :math:`n_i` intervals

   * Compute the error :math:`E_i`

   * Estimate :math:`r_i` from :ref:`(25) <Eq:sec:integrals:testprocs:req>`
     if :math:`i>1`

The corresponding code may look like

.. code-block:: matlab

        function r = convergence_rates(f, F, a, b, num_experiments)
          n = zeros(num_experiments, 1);
          E = zeros(num_experiments, 1);
          r = zeros(num_experiments-1, 1);
          expected = F(b) - F(a);
        
          for i = 1:num_experiments
            n(i) = 2^i;
            computed = trapezoidal(f, a, b, n(i));
            error = abs(expected - computed);
            E(i) = error;
            if (i > 1)
              r(i-1) = log(E(i-1)/E(i))/log(n(i-1)/n(i));
              r(i-1) = round(r(i-1)*100)/100;  % Truncate, two decimals
           end
          end
        end

Making a test function is a matter of choosing ``f``, ``F``, ``a``, and ``b``,
and then checking the value of :math:`r_i` for the largest :math:`i`:

.. code-block:: matlab

        function test_trapezoidal_conv_rate
          % Check empirical convergence rates against the expected -2.
          v = @(t) 3*(t^2)*exp(t^3);
          V = @(t) exp(t^3);
          a = 1.1; b = 1.9;
          num_experiments = 14;
          r = convergence_rates(v, V, a, b, num_experiments)
          tol = 0.01;
          assert(abs(r(num_experiments-1)) - 2 < tol, '%f, %f, %f, %f, %f',...
                           r((num_experiments-1)-4:num_experiments-1));
        end

Running the test shows that all :math:`r_i`, except the first one, equal
the target limit 2 within two decimals. This observation suggest a
tolerance of :math:`10^{-2}`.


.. admonition:: Remark about version control of files

   Having a suite of test functions for automatically checking that your
   software works is considered as a fundamental requirement for reliable
   computing. Equally important is a system that can keep track of
   different versions of the files and the tests, known as a *version control
   system*. Today's most popular version control system is `Git <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)>`__, which the
   authors strongly recommend the reader to use for programming and writing
   reports. The combination of Git and cloud storage such as GitHub is a
   very common way of organizing scientific or engineering work.
   We have a `quick intro <http://hplgit.github.io/teamods/bitgit/Langtangen_bitgit-bootstrap.html>`__ to Git and GitHub that gets you up and running within
   minutes.
   
   The typical workflow with Git goes as follows.
   
   1. Before you start working with files, make sure you have the latest
      version of them by running ``git pull``.
   
   2. Edit files, remove or create files (new files must be registered
      by ``git add``).
   
   3. When a natural piece of work is done, *commit* your changes by the
      ``git commit`` command.
   
   4. Implement your changes also in the cloud by doing ``git push``.
   
   A nice feature of Git is that people can edit the same file at the same
   time and very often Git will be able to automatically merge the changes (!).
   Therefore, version control is crucial when you work with others or when
   you do your work on different types of computers.
   Another key feature is that anyone can at any time view the history of
   a file, see who did what when, and roll back the entire file collection
   to a previous commit. This feature is, of course, fundamental for
   reliable work.




Vectorization          (1)
==========================

.. index:: vectorization

The functions ``midpoint`` and ``trapezoid`` usually run fast in Matlab
and compute an integral to a satisfactory precision within a
fraction of a second. However, long loops in Matlab may run slowly in more
complicated implementations. To increase the speed, the loops
can be replaced by vectorized code. The integration functions constitute
a simple and good example to illustrate how to vectorize loops.

We have already seen simple examples on vectorization in
the section :ref:`1st:ex3` when we could evaluate a mathematical function :math:`f(x)`
for a large number of :math:`x` values stored in an array.
Basically, we can write

.. code-block:: matlab

        function result = f(x)
          result = exp(-x)*sin(x) + 5.*x
        end
        
        x = linspace(0, 4, 101);  # coordinates from 100 intervals on [0, 4]
        y = f(x);                 # all points evaluated at once

The result ``y`` is the array that would be computed if we ran a
``for`` loop over the individual
``x`` values and called ``f`` for each value. Vectorization essentially
eliminates this loop in Matlab (i.e., the looping over ``x`` and application
of ``f`` to each ``x`` value are instead performed
in a library with fast, compiled code).

Vectorizing the midpoint rule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Vectorization of algorithms with loops is a creative process and requires

.. experience.

The aim of vectorizing the ``midpoint`` and ``trapezoidal`` functions is
also to remove the explicit loop in Matlab.
We start with vectorizing the ``midpoint`` function since ``trapezoid``
is not equally straightforward. The fundamental ideas of the vectorized
algorithm are to

1. compute all the evaluation points in one array ``x``

2. call ``f(x)`` to produce an array of corresponding function values

3. use the ``sum`` function to sum the ``f(x)`` values

The evaluation points in the midpoint method are
:math:`x_i=a+(i+\frac{1}{2})h`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,n-1`. That is, :math:`n` uniformly
distributed coordinates between :math:`a+h/2` and :math:`b-h/2`. Such coordinates
can be calculated by ``x = linspace(a+h/2, b-h/2, n)``.
Given that the
Matlab implementation ``f`` of the mathematical function :math:`f` works with
an array argument,
which requires array versions of arithmetic operators (``.+``, ``.*``, etc.)
in Matlab,
``f(x)`` will produce all the function values in an
array. The array elements are then summed up by ``sum``: ``sum(f(x))``. This
sum is to be multiplied by the rectangle width :math:`h` to produce
the integral value. The complete function is listed below.

.. code-block:: matlab

        function result_integration = midpoint_vec(f, a, b, n)
            h = (b-a)/n;
            x = linspace(a + h/2, b - h/2, n);
            result_integration = h*sum(f(x));
        end

The code is found in the file
`integration_methods_vec.m <https://github.com/hplgit/prog4comp/tree/master/src/m/integration_methods_vec.m>`__.
An interactive test reads

.. code-block:: text

        octave:1> v = @(t) 3.*t.^2.*exp(t.^3);
        octave:2> midpoint_vec(v, 0, 1, 10)
        ans =  1.7015

Note the need for the vectorized operator ``.*`` in the function
expression since ``v(x)`` will be called with array arguments ``x``.

The vectorized code performs all loops very efficiently in compiled
code, resulting in much faster execution. Moreover, many readers of
the code will also say that the algorithm looks clearer than in the
loop-based implementation.

Vectorizing the trapezoidal rule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can use the same approach to vectorize the ``trapezoid`` function.
However, the trapezoidal rule performs a sum where the end points
have different weight. If we do ``sum(f(x))``, we get the end points
``f(a)`` and ``f(b)`` with weight unity instead of one half. A remedy
is to subtract the error from ``sum(f(x))``: ``sum(f(x)) - 0.5*f(a) - 0.5*f(b)``.
The vectorized version of the trapezoidal method then becomes

.. code-block:: matlab

        function result_integration = trapezoidal_vec(f, a, b, n)
            h = (b-a)/n;
            x = linspace(a, b, n+1);
            result_integration = h*(sum(f(x)) - 0.5*f(a) - 0.5*f(b))
        end

Measuring computational speed
=============================

.. index:: computational speed (measuring)

Now that we have created faster, vectorized versions of functions in
the previous section, it is interesting to measure how much faster
they are. The purpose of the present section is therefore to
explain how we can record the CPU time consumed by a function so
we can answer this question.
The "stop watch" in Matlab is the function pair ``tic`` (start) and
``toc``. Here is an interactive session measuring the effect of
``midpoint_vec`` versus ``midpoint``:

.. code-block:: text

        octave:1> v = @(t) 3*t^2*exp(t^3);
        octave:2> v_ = @(t) 3.*t.^2.*exp(t.^3);
        octave:3> tic; midpoint_vec(v_, 0, 1, 1000000); toc
        Elapsed time is 0.38 seconds.
        octave:4> tic; midpoint(v_, 0, 1, 1000000); toc
        Elapsed time is 40 seconds.
        octave:5> 40/0.38
        ans =  105.26

The vectorized version is 100 times faster!

.. _sec:int:double:

Double and triple integrals
===========================

.. _sec:int:double:midpoint:

The midpoint rule for a double integral
---------------------------------------

.. index:: domain

.. index::
   single: double integral; midpoint

Given a double integral over a rectangular domain :math:`[a,b]\times [c,d]`,

.. math::
         \int_a^b \int_c^d f(x,y) dydx,

how can we approximate this integral by numerical methods?

Derivation via one-dimensional integrals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since we know how to
deal with integrals in one variable, a fruitful approach is to view
the double integral as two integrals, each in one variable, which
can be approximated numerically by previous one-dimensional formulas.
To this end,
we introduce
a help function :math:`g(x)` and write

.. math::
         \int_a^b \int_c^d f(x,y) dydx = \int_a^b g(x)dx,\quad
        g(x) = \int_c^d f(x,y) dy\thinspace .

Each of the integrals

.. math::
         \int_a^b g(x)dx,\quad
        g(x) = \int_c^d f(x,y) dy

can be discretized by any numerical
integration rule for an integral in one variable. Let us use the
midpoint method
:ref:`(22) <Eq:sec:midpointFormula>`
and start with :math:`g(x)=\int_c^d f(x,y)dy`. We introduce
:math:`n_y` intervals on :math:`[c,d]` with length :math:`h_y`. The midpoint rule
for this integral then becomes

.. math::
         g(x) = \int_c^d f(x,y) dy \approx  h_y \sum_{j=0}^{n_y-1} f(x,y_j),
        \quad y_j = c + \frac{1}{2}{h_y} + jh_y \thinspace . 

The expression looks somewhat different from :ref:`(22) <Eq:sec:midpointFormula>`,
but that is because of the notation: since we integrate in the :math:`y` direction
and will have to work with both :math:`x` and :math:`y` as coordinates, we must
use :math:`n_y` for :math:`n`, :math:`h_y` for :math:`h`, and the counter :math:`i` is more naturally
called :math:`j` when integrating in :math:`y`. Integrals in the :math:`x` direction will use
:math:`h_x` and :math:`n_x` for :math:`h` and :math:`n`, and :math:`i` as counter.

The double integral is :math:`\int_a^b g(x)dx`, which can be approximated
by the midpoint method:

.. math::
         \int_a^b g(x)dx \approx h_x \sum_{i=0}^{n_x-1} g(x_i),\quad x_i=a + \frac{1}{2}{h_x} + ih_x\thinspace .

Putting the formulas together, we arrive at the *composite midpoint method
for a double integral*:

.. math::
        
        \int_a^b \int_c^d f(x,y) dydx \approx
        h_x \sum_{i=0}^{n_x-1} h_y \sum_{j=0}^{n_y-1} f(x_i,y_j)\nonumber
        

.. _Eq:sec:int:double:midpoint:rule:

.. math::

    \tag{26}
    =
        h_xh_y \sum_{i=0}^{n_x-1} \sum_{j=0}^{n_y-1} f(a + \frac{h_x}{2} + ih_x, c + \frac{h_y}{2} + jh_y)\thinspace .
        
        

Direct derivation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The formula :ref:`(26) <Eq:sec:int:double:midpoint:rule>` can also be derived directly
in the two-dimensional case by applying the idea of the midpoint
method. We divide the rectangle :math:`[a,b]\times [c,d]` into
:math:`n_x\times n_y` equal-sized cells. The idea of the midpoint method is
to approximate :math:`f` by a constant over each cell, and evaluate the constant
at the midpoint. Cell :math:`(i,j)` occupies the area

.. math::
         [a+ih_x,a+(i+1)h_x]\times [c+jh_y, c+ (j+1)h_y],

and the midpoint is :math:`(x_i,y_j)` with

.. math::
         x_i=a + ih_x + \frac{1}{2}{h_x} ,\quad y_j = c + jh_y + \frac{1}{2}{h_y}
        \thinspace .

The integral over the cell is therefore :math:`h_xh_y f(x_i,y_j)`, and
the total double integral is the sum over all cells, which is
nothing but formula :ref:`(26) <Eq:sec:int:double:midpoint:rule>`.

Programming a double sum
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index:: double sum

The formula :ref:`(26) <Eq:sec:int:double:midpoint:rule>` involves a double sum,
which is normally implemented as a double for loop. A Matlab function
implementing :ref:`(26) <Eq:sec:int:double:midpoint:rule>` may look like

.. code-block:: matlab

        function result = midpoint_double1(f, a, b, c, d, nx, ny)
            hx = (b - a)/nx;
            hy = (d - c)/ny;
            I = 0;
            for i = 0:(nx-1)
                for j = 0:(ny-1)
                    xi = a + hx/2 + i*hx;
                    yj = c + hy/2 + j*hy;
                    I = I + hx*hy*f(xi, yj);
                end
            end
            result = I;
        end

With this function, which is available in the file
`midpoint_double1.m <https://github.com/hplgit/prog4comp/tree/master/src/m/midpoint_double1.m>`__, we may now
compute some integral :math:`\int_0^2\int_2^3 (2x + y)dydx=9` in an interactive shell
and demonstrate that the function computes the right number:

.. code-block:: python

        >> f = @(x, y) 2*x + y;
        >>> midpoint_double1(f, 0, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5)
        9.0

Reusing code for one-dimensional integrals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   single: code; re-use

It is very natural to write a two-dimensional midpoint method as we did in
function ``midpoint_double1`` when we have the formula :ref:`(26) <Eq:sec:int:double:midpoint:rule>`. However, we could alternatively ask, much as we did in the mathematics,
can we reuse a well-tested implementation for one-dimensional integrals
to compute double integrals? That is, can we use function ``midpoint``

.. code-block:: matlab

        function result_integration = midpoint(f, a, b, n)
            h = (b-a)/n;
            result = 0;
            for i = 0:(n-1)
                result = result + f((a + h/2) + i*h);
            end
            result_integration = h*result;
        end

from the section :ref:`sec:midpoint:code` "twice"?
The answer is yes, if we think as we did in the mathematics: compute
the double integral as a midpoint rule for integrating :math:`g(x)` and define
:math:`g(x_i)` in terms of a midpoint
rule over :math:`f` in the :math:`y` coordinate. The corresponding function has very
short code:

.. code-block:: matlab

        function I = midpoint_double2(f, a, b, c, d, nx, ny)
            function result = g(x)
                result = midpoint(@(y) f(x, y), c, d, ny);
            end
            g_handle = @g;
            I = midpoint(g_handle, a, b, nx);
        end

The important advantage of this implementation is that we reuse a well-tested
function for the standard one-dimensional midpoint rule and that we
apply the one-dimensional rule exactly as in the mathematics.

Verification via test functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How can we test that our functions for the double integral work?
The best unit test is to find a problem where the numerical approximation
error vanishes because then we know exactly what the numerical
answer should be. The midpoint rule is exact for linear functions,
regardless of how many subinterval we use.
Also, any linear two-dimensional function :math:`f(x,y)=px+qy+r` will be integrated
exactly by the two-dimensional midpoint rule. We may pick
:math:`f(x,y)=2x+y` and create a proper *test function* that can automatically
verify our two alternative implementations of the two-dimensional
midpoint rule. To compute the integral of :math:`f(x,y)` we take advantage of
SymPy to eliminate the possibility of errors in hand calculations.
The test function becomes

.. code-block:: matlab

        function test_midpoint_double()
            % Test that a linear function is integrated exactly.
            f = @(x, y) 2*x + y;
        
            a = 0;  b = 2;  c = 2;  d = 3;
            syms x y;
            I_expected = int(int(f, y, c, d), x, a, b);
            % Test three cases: nx < ny, nx = ny, nx > ny
            nx = 3;  ny = 5;
            for i = (0:2)
                nx = nx + 1;  ny = ny - 1;
                I_computed1 = midpoint_double1(f, a, b, c, d, nx, ny);
                I_computed2 = midpoint_double2(f, a, b, c, d, nx, ny);
                tol = 1E-14;
                %fprintf('...
                %  I_expected = %g, I_computed1 = %g, I_computed2 = %g\n',...
                %  I_expected, I_computed1, I_computed2);
        	assert(abs(I_computed1 - I_expected) < tol);
        	assert(abs(I_computed2 - I_expected) < tol);
            end
        end


.. admonition:: Let test functions speak up

   If we call the above ``test_midpoint_double`` function
   and nothing happens, our implementations
   are correct. However, it is somewhat annoying to have a function that
   is completely silent when it works - are we sure all things are properly
   computed? During development it is therefore highly recommended to insert
   a print statement such that we can monitor the calculations and be
   convinced that the test function does what we want. Since a test
   function should not have any print statement, we simply comment it out as
   we have done in the function listed above.




The trapezoidal method can be used as alternative for the midpoint
method.  The derivation of a formula for the double integral and the
implementations follow exactly the same ideas as we explained with the
midpoint method, but there are more terms to write in the
formulas. :ref:`sec:exer:trapezoidal:2D` asks you to carry out
the details. That exercise is a very good test on your understanding of the
mathematical and programming ideas in the present section.

The midpoint rule for a triple integral
---------------------------------------

Theory
~~~~~~

.. index::
   single: triple integral; midpoint

Once a method that works for a one-dimensional problem is generalized
to two dimensions, it is usually quite straightforward to extend the
method to three dimensions. This will now be demonstrated for
integrals. We have the triple integral

.. math::
         \int_{a}^{b} \int_c^d \int_e^f g(x,y,z) dzdydx

and want to approximate the integral by a midpoint rule.
Following the ideas for the double integral, we
split this integral into one-dimensional integrals:

.. math::
        
        p(x,y) &= \int_e^f g(x,y,z) dz\\ 
        q(x) &= \int_c^d p(x,y) dy\\ 
        \int_{a}^{b} \int_c^d \int_e^f g(x,y,z) dzdydx &= \int_a^b q(x)dx
        

For each of these one-dimensional integrals we apply the midpoint rule:

.. math::
        
        p(x,y) = \int_e^f g(x,y,z) dz
        &\approx \sum_{k=0}^{n_z-1} g(x,y,z_k),
        \\ 
        q(x) = \int_c^d p(x,y) dy
        &\approx \sum_{j=0}^{n_y-1} p(x,y_j),
        \\ 
        \int_{a}^{b} \int_c^d \int_e^f g(x,y,z) dzdydx = \int_a^b q(x)dx
        &\approx \sum_{i=0}^{n_x-1} q(x_i),
        

where

.. math::
        
        z_k=e + \frac{1}{2}h_z + kh_z,\quad y_j=c + \frac{1}{2}h_y + jh_y \quad
        x_i=a + \frac{1}{2}h_x + ih_x
        \thinspace .
        

Starting with the formula for :math:`\int_{a}^{b} \int_c^d \int_e^f g(x,y,z) dzdydx`
and inserting the two previous formulas gives

.. math::
        
         \int_{a}^{b} \int_c^d \int_e^f g(x,y,z)\, dzdydx\approx\nonumber

Monte Carlo integration for complex-shaped domains

.. index:: Monte Carlo integration

Repeated use of one-dimensional integration rules to handle double
and triple integrals constitute a working strategy only if the
integration domain is a rectangle or box. For any other shape of
domain, completely different methods must be used. A common approach
for two- and three-dimensional domains is to divide the domain into
many small triangles or tetrahedra and use numerical integration
methods for each triangle or tetrahedron. The overall algorithm and
implementation is too complicated to be addressed in this book.
Instead, we shall employ an alternative, very simple and general method,
called Monte Carlo integration. It can be implemented in half a page of
code, but requires orders of magnitude more
function evaluations in double integrals compared to the midpoint
rule.

However, Monte Carlo integration is much more computationally
efficient than the midpoint rule when computing
higher-dimensional integrals in more than three variables over
hypercube domains.
Our ideas for double and triple integrals can easily be generalized
to handle an integral in :math:`m` variables. A midpoint formula
then involves :math:`m` sums. With :math:`n` cells
in each coordinate direction, the formula requires :math:`n^m` function
evaluations. That is, the computational work explodes as an exponential
function of the number of space dimensions.
Monte Carlo integration, on the other hand, does not suffer from this
explosion of computational work and is the preferred method for
computing higher-dimensional integrals. So, it makes sense in a
chapter on numerical integration to address Monte Carlo methods, both
for handling complex domains and for handling integrals with many variables.

The Monte Carlo integration algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The idea of Monte Carlo integration of :math:`\int_a^b f(x)dx` is to
use the mean-value theorem from calculus, which states that the
integral :math:`\int_a^b f(x)dx` equals the length of the integration
domain, here :math:`b-a`, times the *average* value of :math:`f`, :math:`\bar f`, in
:math:`[a,b]`. The average value can be computed by sampling :math:`f` at
a set of *random* points inside the domain and take the mean of
the function values. In higher dimensions, an integral is estimated
as the area/volume of the domain times the average value, and again
one can evaluate the integrand at a set of random points in the domain
and compute the mean value of those evaluations.

Let us introduce some quantities to help us make the
specification of the integration algorithm more precise.
Suppose we have some two-dimensional integral

.. math::
         \int_\Omega f(x,y)dxdx, 

where :math:`\Omega` is a two-dimensional domain defined via a help function
:math:`g(x,y)`:

.. math::
         \Omega = \{ (x,y)\,|\, g(x,y) \geq 0\} 

That is, points :math:`(x,y)` for which :math:`g(x,y)\geq 0` lie inside :math:`\Omega`,
and points for which :math:`g(x,y)<\Omega` are outside :math:`\Omega`.  The
boundary of the domain :math:`\partial\Omega` is given by the implicit curve
:math:`g(x,y)=0`. Such formulations of geometries have been very common
during the last couple of decades, and one refers to :math:`g` as a
*level-set function* and the boundary :math:`g=0` as the zero-level contour
of the level-set function. For simple geometries one can easily construct
:math:`g` by hand, while in more complicated industrial applications one must
resort to mathematical models for constructing :math:`g`.

Let :math:`A(\Omega)` be the area of a domain :math:`\Omega`.
We can estimate the integral by this Monte Carlo integration method:

1. embed the geometry :math:`\Omega` in a rectangular area :math:`R`

2. draw a large number of *random* points :math:`(x,y)` in :math:`R`

3. count the fraction :math:`q` of points that are inside :math:`\Omega`

4. approximate :math:`A(\Omega)/A(R)` by :math:`q`, i.e., set :math:`A(\Omega) = qA(R)`

5. evaluate the mean of :math:`f`, :math:`\bar f`, at the points inside :math:`\Omega`

6. estimate the integral as :math:`A(\Omega)\bar f`

Note that :math:`A(R)` is trivial to compute since :math:`R` is a rectangle,
while :math:`A(\Omega)` is unknown. However, if we assume that the fraction
of :math:`A(R)` occupied by :math:`A(\Omega)` is the same as the fraction of
random points inside :math:`\Omega`, we get a simple estimate for :math:`A(\Omega)`.

To get an idea of the method, consider a circular domain
:math:`\Omega` embedded in a rectangle as shown below. A collection of
random points is illustrated by black dots.

   :width: 600

Implementation          (4)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Matlab function implementing :math:`\int_\Omega f(x,y)dxdy` can be written
like this:

.. code-block:: matlab

        function result = MonteCarlo_double(f, g, x0, x1, y0, y1, n)
            %
            % Monte Carlo integration of f over a domain g>=0, embedded
            % in a rectangle [x0,x1]x[y0,y1]. n^2 is the number of
            % random points.
            
            % Draw n^2 random points in the rectangle
            x = x0 + (x1 - x0)*rand(n,1);
            y = y0 + (y1 - y0)*rand(n,1);
            % Compute sum of f values inside the integration domain
            f_mean = 0;
            num_inside = 0;   % number of x,y points inside domain (g>=0)
            for i = 1:length(x)
                for j = 1:length(y)
                    if g(x(i), y(j)) >= 0
                        num_inside = num_inside + 1;
                        f_mean = f_mean + f(x(i), y(j));
                    end
                end
            end
            f_mean = f_mean/num_inside;
            area = num_inside/(n^2)*(x1 - x0)*(y1 - y0);
            result = area*f_mean;
        end

(See the file
`MonteCarlo_double.m <https://github.com/hplgit/prog4comp/tree/master/src/m/MonteCarlo_double.m>`__.)

Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A simple test case is to check the area of a rectangle :math:`[0,2]\times[3,4.5]`
embedded in a rectangle :math:`[0,3]\times [2,5]`. The right answer is 3,
but Monte Carlo integration is, unfortunately, never exact so it is
impossible to predict the output of the algorithm. All we know is that
the estimated integral should approach 3 as the number of random points
goes to infinity. Also, for a fixed number of points, we can
run the algorithm several times and get different numbers that fluctuate
around the exact value, since different sample points are used in different
calls to the Monte Carlo integration algorithm.

The area of the rectangle can be computed by the integral :math:`\int_0^2\int_3^{4.5}
dydx`, so in this case we identify
:math:`f(x,y)=1`, and the :math:`g` function can be specified as (e.g.)
1 if :math:`(x,y)` is inside :math:`[0,2]\times[3,4.5]` and :math:`-1` otherwise.
Here is an example on how we can utilize the ``MonteCarlo_double``
function to compute the area for different number of samples:

.. code-block:: python

        >> g = @(x, y) -1 + 2*(0 <= x && x <= 2 && 3 <= y && y <= 4.5);
        >> MonteCarlo_double(@(x, y) 1, g, 0, 3, 2, 5, 100)
        2.9484
        >> MonteCarlo_double(@(x, y) 1, g, 0, 3, 2, 5, 1000)
        2.947032
        >> MonteCarlo_double(@(x, y) 1, g, 0, 3, 2, 5, 1000)
        3.0234600000000005
        >> MonteCarlo_double(@(x, y) 1, g, 0, 3, 2, 5, 2000)
        2.9984580000000003
        >> MonteCarlo_double(@(x, y) 1, g, 0, 3, 2, 5, 2000)
        3.1903469999999996
        >> MonteCarlo_double(@(x, y) 1, g, 0, 3, 2, 5, 5000)
        2.986515

To get a one-line definition of ``g``, we have exploited the fact that each of the
boolean tests (in parenthesis separated by ``&&``) will evaluate to either
0 (if false) or 1 (if true). If all of them evaluate to true, the whole
parenthesis will evaluate to 1 and the number 1 (from :math:`-1 + 2*1`) is returned.
On the other hand, if any single one of the boolean tests evaluate to false,
the parenthesis will evaluate to 0 and the number -1 (from :math:`-1 + 2*0`) is returned.
We see that the values fluctuate around 3, a fact that supports
a correct implementation, but in principle, bugs could be hidden
behind the inaccurate answers.

It is mathematically known that the standard deviation of the Monte Carlo
estimate of an integral converges as :math:`n^{-1/2}`, where :math:`n` is the number
of samples. This kind of convergence rate estimate could be used to
verify the implementation, but this topic is beyond the scope of this book.

.. index:: seed (random generators)

Test function for function with random numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make a test function, we need a unit test that has identical
behavior each time we run the test. This seems difficult when random
numbers are involved, because these numbers are different every time
we run the algorithm, and each run hence produces a (slightly)
different result.  A standard way to test algorithms involving random
numbers is to *fix the seed* of the random number generator. Then the
sequence of numbers is the same every time we run the algorithm.
Assuming that the ``MonteCarlo_double`` function works, we fix the seed,
observe a certain result, and take this result as the correct
result. Provided the test function always uses this seed, we should
get exactly this result every time the ``MonteCarlo_double`` function is
called. Our test function can then be written as shown below.

.. code-block:: matlab

        function test_MonteCarlo_double_rectangle_area()
            % Check the area of a rectangle.
            g = @(x, y) -1 + 2*(0 <= x && x <= 2 && 3 <= y && y <= 4.5);
        
            x0 = 0;  x1 = 3;  y0 = 2;  y1 = 5;  % embedded rectangle
            n = 1000;
            rand("seed", 8);         % must fix the seed!
            I_expected = 3.117285;  % computed with this seed
            I_computed = MonteCarlo_double(@(x,y) 1, g, x0, x1, y0, y1, n);
            assert(abs(I_expected - I_computed) < 1E-14);
        end

(See the file `test_MonteCarlo_double_rectangle_area.m <https://github.com/hplgit/prog4comp/tree/master/src/m/test_MonteCarlo_double_rectangle_area.m>`__.)

Integral over a circle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The test above involves a trivial function :math:`f(x,y)=1`. We should also
test a non-constant :math:`f` function and a more complicated domain. Let
:math:`\Omega` be a circle at the origin with radius 2, and let :math:`f=\sqrt{x^2
+ y^2}`.  This choice makes it possible to compute an exact result: in
polar coordinates, :math:`\int_\Omega f(x,y)dxdy` simplifies to
:math:`2\pi\int_0^2 r^2dr = 16\pi/3`.  We must be prepared for quite crude
approximations that fluctuate around this exact result. As in the test
case above, we experience better results with larger number of points.
When we have such evidence for a working implementation, we can turn
the test into a proper test function. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: matlab

        function test_MonteCarlo_double_circle_r()
            % Check the integral of r over a circle with radius 2.
            function result = g(x, y)
                xc = 0; yc = 0;    % center
                R = 2;             % radius
                result =  R^2 - ((x-xc)^2 + (y-yc)^2);
            end
            g_handle = @g;
        
            % Exact: integral of r*r*dr over circle with radius R becomes
            % 2*pi*1/3*R^3
            syms r;
            I_exact = int(@(r) 2*pi*r*r, r, 0, 2);
            fprintf('Exact integral: %g\n', I_exact);
            x0 = -2;  x1 = 2;  y0 = -2;  y1 = 2;
            n = 1000;
            rand("seed", 6);                % must fix the seed!
            I_expected = 16.85949525320151  % Computed with this seed
            I_computed = MonteCarlo_double(...
                       @(x, y) sqrt(x^2 + y^2), g_handle, x0, x1, y0, y1, n);
            fprintf('MC approximation (%d samples): %.16f', n^2, I_computed);
            assert(abs(I_computed - I_expected) < 1E-15);
        end

Exercise 31: Compute a simple integral
--------------------------------------

.. solution=`sol_integrate_parabola.pdf`

Apply the ``trapezoidal`` and ``midpoint`` functions to compute
the integral :math:`\int_2^6 x(x -1)dx` with 2 and 100 subintervals.
Compute the error too.

.. --- begin solution of exercise ---

**Solution.**
The code may be written as follows

.. code-block:: matlab

        function integrate_parabola()
            f = @(x) x*(x-1);
            a = 2; b = 6; 
            n = 2
            %n = 100
        
            numerical_trap = trapezoidal(f, a, b, n);
            numerical_mid = midpoint(f, a, b, n);
        
            exact = 53.333        % Rounded
            error_trap = abs(numerical_trap - exact);
            error_mid = abs(numerical_mid - exact);
        
            fprintf('For n = %d, we get: \n', n);
            fprintf('Numerical trapezoid: %g , Error: %g \n',...
                                       numerical_trap, error_trap);
            fprintf('Numerical midpoint: %g , Error: %g \n',...
                                         numerical_mid, error_mid);
        end

In the code, we have taken the opportunity to show
how commenting often is used to switch between two
code fragments, typically single statements. The
alternatives ``n = 2`` and ``n = 100`` are switched by
removing/adding the comment sign ``#``, before running
the code anew. Another alternative would of course be
to ask the user for the value of ``n``.
Running the program with ``n = 2``, produces the following printout:

.. code-block:: text

        For n = 2, we get:
        Numerical trapezoid: 56 , Error: 2.667
        Numerical midpoint: 52 , Error: 1.333

while running it with ``n = 100`` gives:

.. code-block:: text

        For n = 100, we get:
        Numerical trapezoid: 53.3344 , Error: 0.0014
        Numerical midpoint: 53.3328 , Error: 0.0002

The analytical value of the integral is 53.333 (rounded).

Exercise 32: Hand-calculations with sine integrals
--------------------------------------------------

.. solution=`sol_integrate_sine.pdf`

We consider integrating the sine function: :math:`\int_0^b \sin (x)dx`.

**a)**
Let :math:`b=\pi` and use two intervals in the trapezoidal and midpoint method.
Compute the integral by hand and illustrate how the two numerical
methods approximates the integral. Compare with the exact value.

.. --- begin solution of exercise ---

**Solution.**
Analytically, the integral computes to 2. By hand, with the trapezoidal method,
we get 1.570. Graphically (Figure :ref:`fig:intgr_sine_a_trap`), it is clear that
the numerical approach will have to under-estimate the true result.

The area under the blue graph in Figure :ref:`fig:intgr_sine_a_trap`
corresponds to the "true" area under the graph of the integrand. The area
under the red graph corresponds to what you get with the trapezoidal method and
two intervals.

.. _fig:intgr_sine_a_trap:

   *The integral computed with the trapezoidal method (n = 2)*

By hand, with the midpoint method, we get 2.221. Graphically (Figure :ref:`fig:intgr_sine_a_mid`),
we might see that the numerical approach will have to over-estimate the true result.
Again, the area under the blue graph in Figure :ref:`fig:intgr_sine_a_mid`
corresponds to the "true" area under the graph of the integrand. The area
under the red graph corresponds to what you get with the midpoint method and
two intervals.

   *The integral computed with the midpoint method (n = 2)*

.. --- end solution of exercise ---

**b)**
Do a) when :math:`b=2\pi`.

.. --- begin solution of exercise ---

**Solution.**
Analytically, the integral computes to zero. In this case, both numerical methods will correctly calculate the integral to zero even with just two intervals! Graphically, we see that they arrive at zero for "different reasons". The trapezoidal method constructs both its trapezoids by use of the function (integrand) value at the midpoint of the whole interval. However, there the integrand crosses the x-axis, i.e. it evaluates to zero. The "area" computed by the trapezoidal method becomes the zero area located "between" the green graph and the x-axis in Figure :ref:`fig:intgr_sine_b_trap_mid`. The midpoint method computes the areas of two rectangles (red graph in Figure :ref:`fig:intgr_sine_b_trap_mid`), but since the signs of these equal areas differ, they add to zero.

Exercise 33: Make test functions for the midpoint method

Modify the file ``test_trapezoidal.m`` such that the
three tests are applied to the function ``midpoint`` implementing
the midpoint method for integration.

.. --- begin solution of exercise ---

**Solution.**
Note that also the midpoint method will do an exact (to within machine precision)
integration when the integrand is a straight line. This is so, since the errors
from each rectangle will cancel. The code reads:

.. code-block:: matlab

        function test_midpoint()

Exercise 34: Explore rounding errors with large numbers
-------------------------------------------------------

.. solution=`sol_test_trapezoidal2.pdf`

The trapezoidal method integrates linear functions exactly, and this
property was used in the test function ``test_trapezoidal_linear`` in the file
``test_trapezoidal.m``. Change the function used in
the section :ref:`sec:integrals:testprocs` to :math:`f(x)=6\cdot 10^8 x - 4\cdot 10^6`
and rerun the test. What happens? How must you change the test
to make it useful? How does the convergence rate test behave? Any need
for adjustment?

.. --- begin solution of exercise ---

**Solution.**
With the new function given, we get the error message that includes:

.. code-block:: text

        AssertionError: n = 2, err = 9.53674e-07

The numerical calculation then obviously differs from the exact value by
more than what is specified in the tolerance ``tol``. We may understand this
by considering the new function, i.e., :math:`f(x)=6\cdot 10^8 x - 4\cdot 10^6`.
Any rounding error in :math:`x` will get magnified big time by the factor :math:`6\cdot 10^8` in front,
i.e. the slope of the line. This makes the numerical calculation more inaccurate than previously.
To fix this problem, we have several options. One possibility is to relax the tolerance, but
this is not very satisfactory. After all, the calculation is supposed to be "exact" for a straight
line. Another alternative is to introduce a new integration variable such
that we scale the interval :math:`[a,b]` into :math:`[\frac{a}{6\cdot 10^8},\frac{b}{6\cdot 10^8}]`, as
this will neutralize the huge factor in front of :math:`x`, bringing the accuracy back to where it was previously. This
alternative is implemented in
`test_trapezoidal2.m <https://github.com/hplgit/prog4comp/tree/master/src/m/test_trapezoidal2.m>`__.

.. code-block:: matlab

        function test_trapezoidal_linear_scale()

            f = @(x) 6E8*x - 4E6;

            a = 1.2/6E8;  b = 4.4/6E8;      % Scale interval down
            exact = F(b) - F(a);
            tol = 1E-14;

                numerical = trapezoidal(f, a, b, n);

                assert(err < tol, 'n = %d, err = %g', n, err);
            end
        end

        end
        
        function test_trapezoidal_linear_scale()
            % Check that linear functions are integrated exactly
            f = @(x) 6E8*x - 4E6;

            a = 1.2/6E8;  b = 4.4/6E8;      % Scale interval down
            exact = F(b) - F(a);
            tol = 1E-14;
            for n = [2 20 21]
                numerical = trapezoidal(f, a, b, n);
                err = abs(exact - numerical);
                assert(err < tol, 'n = %d, err = %g', n, err);
            end
        end
        
        function test_trapezoidal_linear_reldiff()
            % Check that linear functions are integrated exactly
            f = @(x) 6E8*x - 4E6;
            F = @(x) 3E8*x^2 - 4E6*x;       % Anti-derivative
            a = 1.2;  b = 4.4
            exact = F(b) - F(a);
            tol = 1E-14;
            for n = [2 20 21]
                numerical = trapezoidal(f, a, b, n);
                err = abs(exact - numerical)/exact;
                assert(err < tol, 'n = %d, err = %g', n, err);
            end
        end

The best alternative, however, is to consider relative differences instead
of absolute differences. That is, we compute ``(exact - numerical)/exact``
instead of just ``exact - numerical``. This relative error is :math:`10^{-16}`
even if we compute with very big numbers.

.. code-block:: matlab

        function test_trapezoidal_linear_reldiff()
            % Check that linear functions are integrated exactly
            f = @(x) 6E8*x - 4E6;
            F = @(x) 3E8*x^2 - 4E6*x;       % Anti-derivative
            a = 1.2;  b = 4.4
            exact = F(b) - F(a);
            tol = 1E-14;
            for n = [2 20 21]
                numerical = trapezoidal(f, a, b, n);
                err = abs(exact - numerical)/exact;
                assert(err < tol, 'n = %d, err = %g', n, err);
            end
        end

Computing convergence rates is not meaningful in this test, because the
error is mathematically zero.

.. Closing remarks for this Exercise

Remarks          (4)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The convergence rate test fails. Printing out ``r`` shows that the
actual convergence rate for this integral is :math:`-1.5` and not :math:`-2`.
The reason is that the `error in the trapezoidal method <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule#Error_analysis>`__
is :math:`-(b-a)^3n^{-2}f''(\xi)` for some (unknown) :math:`\xi\in [a,b]`.
With :math:`f(x)=\sqrt{x}`, :math:`f''(\xi)\rightarrow -\infty` as :math:`\xi\rightarrow 0`,
pointing to a potential problem in the size of the error.
Running a test with :math:`a>0`, say :math:`\int_{0.1}^4\sqrt{x}dx` shows that
the convergence rate is indeed restored to -2.

Exercise 36: Rectangle methods
------------------------------

.. solution=`sol_rectangle_methods.pdf`

The midpoint method divides the interval of integration into equal-sized
subintervals and approximates the integral in each subinterval by
a rectangle whose height equals the function value at the midpoint of
the subinterval. Instead, one might use either the left or right end of
the subinterval as illustrated in Figure :ref:`fig:vCarRectangle`.
This defines a *rectangle method* of integration. The height of the
rectangle can be based on the left or right end or the midpoint.

computing an integral :math:`\int_a^bf(x)dx` by the rectangle method

Exercise 37: Adaptive integration
---------------------------------

.. solution=`sol_adaptive_integration.pdf`

Suppose we want to use the trapezoidal or midpoint method to
compute an integral :math:`\int_a^b f(x)dx` with an error less than
a prescribed tolerance :math:`\epsilon`. What is the appropriate
size of :math:`n`?

To answer this question, we may enter an iterative procedure where
we compare the results produced by :math:`n` and :math:`2n` intervals,
and if the difference is smaller than :math:`\epsilon`, the value corresponding
to :math:`2n` is returned. Otherwise, we halve :math:`n` and repeat the procedure.

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint.**
It may be a good idea to organize your code so that the function ``adaptive_integration`` can be used
easily in future programs you write.

.. --- end hint in exercise ---

**a)**
Write a function

.. code-block:: text

        adaptive_integration(f, a, b, eps, method=midpoint)

that implements the idea above (``eps`` corresponds to the tolerance
:math:`\epsilon`, and ``method`` can be ``midpoint`` or ``trapezoidal``).

.. --- begin solution of exercise ---

**Solution.**
To ease future use of adaptive integration, we save the function ``adaptive_integration``
in a separate file ``adaptive_integration.m``:

.. code-block:: matlab

        function n_final = adaptive_integration(f, a, b, eps, method)
            n_limit = 1000000; % Just a choice (to avoid inf loop)
            n = 2; 
            if (method == 't')
                integral_n = trapezoidal(f, a, b, n);
                integral_2n = trapezoidal(f, a, b, 2*n);
                diff = abs(integral_2n - integral_n);
                fprintf('trapezoidal diff: %g \n', diff); 
                while (diff > eps) && (n < n_limit)
                    integral_n = trapezoidal(f, a, b, n);
                    integral_2n = trapezoidal(f, a, b, 2*n);
                    diff = abs(integral_2n - integral_n);
                    fprintf('trapezoidal diff: %g \n', diff);
                    n = 2*n;
                end
            elseif method == 'm'
                integral_n = midpoint(f, a, b, n);
                integral_2n = midpoint(f, a, b, 2*n);
                diff = abs(integral_2n - integral_n);
                fprintf('midpoint diff: %g \n', diff); 
                while (diff > eps) && (n < n_limit)
                    integral_n = midpoint(f, a, b, n);
                    integral_2n = midpoint(f, a, b, 2*n);
                    diff = abs(integral_2n - integral_n);
                    fprintf('midpoint diff: %g \n', diff);
                    n = 2*n;
                end
            else
                display('Error - adaptive integr called with unknown par');
            end
            % Now we check if acceptable n was found or not
            if diff <= eps     % Success 
                fprintf('The integral computes to: %g \n', integral_2n);
                n_final = n;
            else
                n_final = -n;   % Return negative n to tell "not found"
            end
        end

.. --- end solution of exercise ---

**b)**
Test the method on :math:`\int_0^2x^2dx` and :math:`\int_0^2\sqrt{x}dx`
for :math:`\epsilon = 10^{-1}, 10^{-10}` and write out the exact error.

.. --- begin solution of exercise ---

**Solution.**
The function ``adaptive_integration`` may be applied (as required in *b* and *c*)
by the statements in ``use_my_adaptive_integration.m``:

.. code-block:: matlab

        %...tasks b) and c)
        
        f = @(x) x^2;
        g = @(x) sqrt(x);
        
        %eps = 1E-1;        % Just switch between these two eps values
        eps = 1E-10;
        
        %a = 0.0;
        a = 0.0 + 0.01;     % If we adjust a, sqrt(x) is handled easily
        b = 2.0;
        
        %...f
        
        n = adaptive_integration(f, a, b, eps, 'm');  % 'm' for midpoint
        if n > 0
            fprintf('Sufficient n is: %d', n);
        else
            fprintf('No n was found in %d iterations \n', abs(n));
        end
        
        n = adaptive_integration(f, a, b, eps, 't');  % 't' for trapezoid
        if n > 0
            fprintf('Sufficient n is: %d', n);
        else
            fprintf('No n was found in %d iterations \n', abs(n));
        end
        
        %...g
        
        n = adaptive_integration(g, a, b, eps, 'm');
        if n > 0
            fprintf('Sufficient n is: %d', n);
        else
            fprintf('No n was found in %d iterations \n', abs(n));
        end
        
        n = adaptive_integration(g, a, b, eps, 't');
        if n > 0
            fprintf('Sufficient n is: %d', n);
        else
            fprintf('No n was found in %d iterations \n', abs(n));
        end
        
        %task c, make plot for both midpoint and trapezoidal
            
        eps = linspace(1E-1, 10E-10, 10);
        n_m = zeros(length(eps), 1);
        n_t = zeros(length(eps), 1);
        for i = 1:length(n_m)
            n_m(i) = adaptive_integration(g, a, b, eps(i), 'm');
            n_t(i) = adaptive_integration(g, a, b, eps(i), 't');
        end 
        plot(log(eps), n_m, 'b-', log(eps), n_t, 'r-');
        xlabel('log(eps)');
        ylabel('n for midpoint (blue) and trapezoidal (red)');
        n
        eps

Note that, in our suggested code, it is foreseen that the programmer switches between the
two epsilon values by use of commenting, i.e.
adding/removing ``%``. This may of course be avoided, if desirable, by asking the user for epsilon.

.. --- end solution of exercise ---

**c)**
Make a plot of :math:`n` versus :math:`\epsilon \in [10^{-1}, 10^{-10}]` for
:math:`\int_0^2\sqrt{x}dx`. Use logarithmic scale for :math:`\epsilon`.

.. --- begin solution of exercise ---

**Solution.**
From Figure :ref:`fig:adaptIntegr`, we see that the stricter the value of epsilon, the larger the
difference between the midpoint and the trapezoidal methods. For a given value for epsilon, the
midpoint method comes within the tolerance with fewer intervals (lower value of ``n``) than does
the trapezoidal method. This should be expected, since the midpoint method is somewhat more accurate
than the trapezoidal method.

.. Closing remarks for this Exercise

Remarks          (5)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The type of method explored in this exercise is called *adaptive*,
because it tries to adapt the value of :math:`n` to meet a given
error criterion. The true error can very seldom be computed
(since we do not know the exact answer to the computational
problem), so one has to find other indicators of the error, such
as the one here where the changes in the integral value, as
the number of intervals is doubled, is taken to reflect the error.

Exercise 38: Integrating x raised to x
--------------------------------------

.. solution=`sol_integrate_x2x.pdf`

Consider the integral

.. math::
         I = \int_0^4 x^x\,dx\thinspace .

The integrand :math:`x^x` does not have an anti-derivative that can be expressed in terms of standard functions (visit `<http://wolframalpha.com>`_ and type
``integral(x^x,x)`` to convince yourself that
our claim is right. Note that Wolfram alpha does give you an answer, but that answer is an approximation, it is *not* exact. This is because
Wolfram alpha too uses numerical methods to arrive at the answer, just as you will in this exercise). Therefore, we are forced to compute the integral by numerical methods. Compute a result that is right to four digits.

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint.**
Use ideas from :ref:`sec:exer:adaptive:int`.

.. --- end hint in exercise ---

.. --- begin solution of exercise ---

**Solution.**
When the function ``adaptive_integration`` is available, the code may be written as:

.. code-block:: matlab

        f = @(x) x^x;
        
        eps = 1E-4;
        a = 0.0; b = 2.0
        
        % ...choose the midpoint method
        n = adaptive_integration(f, a, b, eps, 'm');  % m for midpoint
        
        if n > 0
            fprintf('Sufficient n is: %d \n', n); 
        else
            % The negative n is returned to signal that the upper 
            % limit of n was passed. 
            fprintf('No n was found in %d iterations \n', abs(n));
        end

Remember that ``adaptive_integration`` prints out the computed integral, so no effort
in that respect is required here.

Running the program, gives a printout to the screen showing how ``diff`` gets smaller and
smaller each time. The final two lines of the printout read:

.. code-block:: text

        The integral computes to: 2.83384395958
        Sufficient n is: 256

The computed value may be compared to what Wolfram alpha gives. Remember that since we
have not computed the exact error, we can *not* guarantee that the
"result is right to four digits". However, we have reason to believe that we "are close".
Typically, when it is known that the error measure used is not precise, the tolerance is
made stricter.

Exercise 40: Revisit fit of sines to a function
-----------------------------------------------

.. solution=`sol_autofit_sines.pdf`

This is a continuation of :ref:`2nd:exer:fitSines`. The task is to
approximate a given function :math:`f(t)` on :math:`[-\pi,\pi]` by a sum of sines,

.. _Eq:_auto4:

.. math::

    \tag{28}
    S_N(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} b_n \sin(nt)\thinspace .
        
        

We are now interested in computing the unknown coefficients :math:`b_n`
such that :math:`S_N(t)` is in some sense the *best approximation* to :math:`f(t)`.
One common way of doing this is to first set up a general expression
for the *approximation error*, measured by "summing up" the
squared deviation of :math:`S_N` from :math:`f`:

.. math::
         E = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi}(S_N(t)-f(t))^2dt\thinspace .

We may view :math:`E` as a function of :math:`b_1,\ldots,b_N`. Minimizing :math:`E`
with respect to :math:`b_1,\ldots,b_N` will give us a *best approximation*,
in the sense that we adjust :math:`b_1,\ldots,b_N` such that :math:`S_N` deviates
as little as possible from :math:`f`.

Minimization of a function of :math:`N` variables, :math:`E(b_1,\ldots,b_N)` is
mathematically performed by requiring all the partial derivatives
to be zero:

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial E}{\partial b_1} & = 0,\\ 
        \frac{\partial E}{\partial b_2} & = 0,\\ 
        &\vdots\\ 
        \frac{\partial E}{\partial b_N} & = 0\thinspace .
        

**a)**
Compute the partial derivative :math:`\partial E/\partial b_1` and
generalize to the arbitrary case :math:`\partial E/\partial b_n`, :math:`1\leq n\leq N`.

.. --- begin solution of exercise ---

**Solution.**

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial E}{\partial b_1}  = \frac{\partial}{\partial b_1} (\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}(S_N(t)-f(t))^2dt),                 \nonumber 
        

.. math::
          
                                         = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \frac{\partial}{\partial b_1}((S_N(t)-f(t))^2dt),                 \nonumber 
        

.. math::
          
                                         = 2\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} (S_N(t)-f(t))\sin(t)dt,                                           \nonumber
        

where it has been assumed that the integrand is such that the partial derivative can be moved inside the integration.

We see that the partial derivative of :math:`E` with respect to any one of the :math:`b` coefficients will take on the same form, meaning that

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial E}{\partial b_n} = 2\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} (S_N(t)-f(t))\sin(nt)dt,              \nonumber
        

where :math:`1\leq n\leq N`.

.. --- end solution of exercise ---

Show that

.. math::
         b_n = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(t)\sin(nt)\,dt\thinspace .

**Solution.**
Requiring

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial E}{\partial b_n} = 0,              \nonumber
        

means that the following must apply,

.. math::
        
        2\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} (S_N(t)-f(t))\sin(nt)dt = 0.              \nonumber
        

This may be rewritten as

        \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} S_N(t)\sin(nt)dt = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(t)\sin(nt)dt              \nonumber
        

or, if we insert the expression for :math:`S_N`, we get

.. math::
        
        \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} (\sum_{i=1}^{N} b_i \sin(it))\sin(nt)dt = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(t)\sin(nt)dt,              \nonumber
        

where the summation variable in :math:`S_N` has been changed from :math:`n` to :math:`i`, avoiding conflict with the :math:`n` already present in :math:`\sin(nt)`.

Now, since

.. math::
        
        \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \sin^2(nt)dt = \pi,              \nonumber
        

while

.. math::
        
        \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \sin(it)\sin(nt)dt = 0,              \nonumber
        

when :math:`i \neq n`, we arrive at

.. math::
         b_n = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(t)\sin(nt)\,dt\thinspace .

**d)**
A remarkable property of the trapezoidal rule is that it is exact for integrals
:math:`\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\sin nt\,dt` (when subintervals are of equal size). Use this
property to create a function ``test_integrate_coeff`` to verify the
implementation of ``integrate_coeffs``.

.. --- end solution of exercise ---

**e)**
Implement the choice :math:`f(t) = \frac{1}{\pi}t` as a Matlab function
``f(t)`` and call ``integrate_coeffs(f, 3, 100)`` to see what the
optimal choice of :math:`b_1, b_2, b_3` is.

**f)**
Make a function ``plot_approx(f, N, M, filename)`` where you plot ``f(t)``

**Solution.**
See code given above. Running the program will produce one plot (Figure :ref:`fig:S_N3`, Figure :ref:`fig:S_N6`, Figure :ref:`fig:S_N12` and Figure :ref:`fig:S_N24`) for each value of :math:`N`. We see from the plots that the larger the :math:`N`, the better the approximation.

**h)**
Run ``plot_approx`` for :math:`f(t) = e^{-(t-\pi)}` and :math:`N=100`.
Observe a fundamental problem: regardless of :math:`N`, :math:`S_N(-\pi)=0`, not
:math:`e^{2\pi}\approx 535`. (There are ways to fix this issue.)

**Solution.**
See code given above. Running the program (also) produces the plot seen in Figure :ref:`fig:new_f_S_N100`. Clearly, the approximation is no good at the endpoints of the interval.

Exercise 41: Derive the trapezoidal rule for a double integral
--------------------------------------------------------------

Use ideas in the section :ref:`sec:int:double:midpoint` to derive a formula
for computing a double integral :math:`\int_a^b\int_c^d f(x,y)dydx` by the
trapezoidal rule.  Implement and test this rule.

.. --- begin solution of exercise ---

**Solution.**
We introduce a help function :math:`g(x)` and write

.. math::
         \int_a^b \int_c^d f(x,y) dydx = \int_a^b g(x)dx,\quad
        g(x) = \int_c^d f(x,y) dy\thinspace .

Next, we apply the trapezoidal rule (:ref:`sec:integrals:trap`) to each of the integrals

.. math::
         \int_a^b g(x)dx,\quad
        g(x) = \int_c^d f(x,y) dy\thinspace .

Starting with :math:`g(x)=\int_c^d f(x,y)dy`, we introduce
:math:`n_y` intervals on :math:`[c,d]` with length :math:`h_y`. The trapezoidal rule
for this integral then becomes

.. math::
         g(x) = \int_c^d f(x,y) dy \approx  h_y \left[\frac{1}{2}f(x,c) + \sum_{j=1}^{n_y-1}f(x,y_j) + \frac{1}{2}f(x,d) \right],

with :math:`y_j = c + jh_y`.
For the outer integral :math:`\int_a^b g(x)dx`, we get:

.. math::
         \int_a^b g(x)dx \approx h_x \left[\frac{1}{2}g(a) + \sum_{i=1}^{n_x-1}g(x_i) + \frac{1}{2}g(b) \right],
        \quad x_i=a + ih_x\thinspace .

Combining the formulas, we get the *composite trapezoidal method
for a double integral*:

.. math::
        
        \int_a^b \int_c^d f(x,y) dydx \approx
        h_x \biggl[\frac{1}{2}\left(h_y \left[\frac{1}{2}f(a,c) +
        \sum_{j=1}^{n_y-1}f(a,y_j) + \frac{1}{2}f(a,d) \right]\right) + \nonumber
        

.. math::
          
        \quad \sum_{i=1}^{n_x-1}\left(h_y \left[\frac{1}{2}f(x_i,c) + \sum_{j=1}^{n_y-1}f(x_i,y_j) + \frac{1}{2}f(x_i,d) \right]\right)+\nonumber
        

.. math::
          
        \quad \frac{1}{2}\left(h_y \left[\frac{1}{2}f(b,c) + \sum_{j=1}^{n_y-1}f(b,y_j) + \frac{1}{2}f(b,d) \right]\right) \biggr]\nonumber
        

.. math::
          
        =
        h_xh_y \biggl[\frac{1}{4}\left(f(a,c) + f(a,d) + f(b,c) + f(b,d) \right) +\nonumber
        

.. math::
          
        \quad \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n_x-1}\left(f(a + ih_x,c) + f(a + ih_x,d)\right) +
        \nonumber
        

.. math::
          
        \quad \frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^{n_y-1}\left(f(a,c + jh_y) + f(b,c + jh_y)\right) +
        \nonumber
        

.. math::
          
        \quad \sum_{i=1}^{n_x-1} \sum_{j=1}^{n_y-1} f(a + ih_x, c + jh_y)\biggr]\thinspace .
        \nonumber
        

The formula may be implemented and tested as shown in ``trapezoidal_double.m`` and
``test_trapezoidal_double.m``, respectively:

.. code-block:: matlab

        function result = trapezoidal_double(f, a, b, c, d, nx, ny)

            Ix = 0;
            for i = 1:(nx-1)
                xi = a + i*hx;
                Ix = Ix + f(xi, c) + f(xi, d);

            Ixy = 0;

                    Ixy = Ixy + f(xi, yj);
                end
            end
            I = I + Ixy;
            I = hx*hy*I;
            result = I;
