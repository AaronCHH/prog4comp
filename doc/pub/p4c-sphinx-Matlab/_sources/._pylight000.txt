Programming for Computations (MATLAB/Octave version)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

:Authors: Svein Linge, Hans Petter Langtangen

.. This small preface is the back cover text, but will appear together

.. with the title on the first page of latex pdf and html.

This text teaches computer programming as a method for solving
mathematical problems. There are two versions of this book, one for
the MATLAB and one for Python. While it was inspired by the Springer
text TCSE6: A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python (by
Langtangen), its exposition is more accessible, simpler, and much
shorter and aimed at engineering students. The authors have outlined
the shortest possible path from zero knowledge about programming to a
set of skills that will allow the students in engineering and science
courses to write simple programs for solving common mathematical
problems by numerical methods. This text places great emphasis on
generic algorithms, clean program designs, function use, and automatic
tests for verification.
